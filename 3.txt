Introduction

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is widely recognised as 
a reliable means of assessing the language ability of candidates who need to study 
or work where English is the language of communication. These Practice Tests are 
designed to give future IELTS candidates an idea of whether their English is at the 
required level.
IELTS is owned by three partners, Cambridge English Language Assessment, part of 
the University of Cambridge, the British Council and IDP Education Pty Limited (through 
its subsidiary company, IELTS Australia Pty Limited). Further information on IELTS can 
be found on the IELTS website www.ielts.org.

WHAT IS THE TEST FORMAT?

IELTS consists of four components. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking 
tests. There is a choice of Reading and Writing tests according to whether a candidate is 
taking the Academic or General Training module.

Academic

undergraduate or postgraduate levels, 
and for those seeking professional 
registration.

General Training
For candidates wishing to migrate to an 
English-speaking country (Australia, Canada,

This test takes between 11 and 14 minutes 
and is conducted 
by a trained 
examiner. 
There are three parts: 

Part 1 

The candidate

and is asked to talk on a particular 
topic. 
The candidate 
has one minute to prepare 
and they can make some notes if they wish, 
before speaking 
for between one and two minutes. 
The examiner 
then asks one or two 
questions 
on the same topic. 

Part 3 

The examiner 
and the candidate 
engage in a discussion 
of more abstract 
issues which are 
thematically 
linked 
to the topic in Part 2. The discussion 
lasts between four and five minutes.

Introduction 

HOW IS IELTS SCORED? 

IELTS results are reported on a nine-band scale. In addition to the score for ove rall language 
ability, IELTS provides a score in the form of a profile for each of the four skills (Listening, 
Reading , Writing and Speaking). These scores are also reported on a nine-band scale. Al l 
scores are recorded on the Test Report Form along with details of the candidate's nationality , 
first language and date of birth. Each Overall Band Score corresponds to a descriptive 
statement which gives a summary of the English language ability of a candidate classified at 
that level. The nine bands and their descriptive statements are as follows : 

9 Expert User - Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate , accurate and 
fluent with complete understanding. 

8 Very Good User - Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional 
unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in 
unfamiliar situations . Handles complex detailed argumentation well. 

7 Good User - Has operational command of the language, though with occasional 
inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally 
handles complex language weJI and understands detailed reasoning . 

6 Competen t User - Has generally effective command of the language despit e some 
inaccu racies, inapprop riacies and misunder s tandings. Can use and unde rs tand fairly 
compl ex language , part ic ula rly in famili ar si tuat ions. 

5 Modest User - Has partial command of the language , coping with overall meaning in 
most situations , though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic 
communicat ion in own field. 

4 Limited User - Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems 
in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language. 

3 Extremely Limited User - Conveys and understands only general meaning in very 
familiar situations. Frequen t breakdowns in communication occur. 

2 Intermittent User - No real communication is possible except for the most basic 
information using isol ated words .or short formulae in familiar situations and to meJ~t 
immediate needs . Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English . 

1 Non User - Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated 
words. 

0 Did not attempt the test- No assessable inform a tion p rovid ed.

Introduction 

MARKING THE PRACTICE TESTS 

Listening and Reading 

The Answer Keys are on pages 116-123 . 
Each question in the Listening and Reading tests is worth one mark . 

Questions which require letter I Roman numeral answers 

• For questions where the answers are letters or Roman numerals, you should write only 
the number of answers required. For example, if the answer is a single letter or numeral 
you should write only one answer. If you have written more letters or numerals than are 
required, the answer must be marked wrong. 

Questions which require answers in the form of words or numbers 

• Answers may be written in upper or lower case . 
• Words in brackets are optional - they are correct, but not necessary . 
• Alternative answers are separated by a slash (/). 
• 
If you are asked to write an answer using a certain number of words and/or (a) 
number(s), you will be penalised if you exceed this. For example, if a question specifies 
an answer using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS and the correct answer is 'black 
leather coat', the answer 'coat of black leather ' is incorrect. 
In questions where you are expected to complete a gap, you should only transfer the 
necessary missing word(s) onto the answer sheet. For example, to complete 'in the ... ', 
where the correct answer is 'morning', the answer 'in the morning' would be incorrect. 
• All answers require correct spelling (including words in brackets) . 
• Both US and UK spelling are acceptable and are included in the Answer Key. 
• All standard alternatives for numbers, dates and currencies are acceptable. 
• All standard abbreviations are acceptable. 
• You will find additional notes about individual answers in the Answer Key . 

• 

Writing 

The sample answers are on pages 124-131. It is not possible for you to give yourself a mark 
for the Writing tasks. We have provided sample answers (written by candidates), showing 
their score and the examiner's comments. These sample answers will give you an insight 
into what is required for the Writing test.

Introduction 

HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES? 

At the end of each Listening and Reading Answer Key you will find a chart which will help 
you assess whether, on the basis of your Practice Test results, you are ready to take the 
IELTS test. 
In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind. Your 
performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band Score 
from 1 to 9 for each of the components and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which 
is the average of your scores in the four components . However, institutions considering 
your application are advised to look at both the Overall Band Score and the Bands for 
each component in order to determine whether you have the language skills needed for a 
particular course of study. For example, if your course involves a lot of reading and writing, 
but no lectures, listening skills might be less important and a score of 5 in Listening might be 
acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a course which has lots of lectures 
and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening might be unacceptable even though the 
Overall Band Score was 7 . 
Once you have marked your tests, you should have some idea of whether your listening 
and reading skills are good enough for you to try the IELTS test. If you did well enough in 
. one component, but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are ready 
to take the test. 
The Practice Tests have been checked to ensure that they are of approximately the same 
level of difficulty as the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the 
Practice Tests will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you 
an idea of your poss ible future performance and it is u ltimately up to you to make decisions 
based on your score. 
Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have 
based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept. 
The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score than 
most other institutions.

Test5 

READING PASSAGE 

1 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13 , which are based on Reading 
Passage 1 below. 

Cork 

Cork - the thick bark of the cork oak 
tree (Quercus suber) - is a remarkable 
material. It is tough, elastic, buoyant , 
and fire-resistant, and su itab le for a 
wide range of purposes. It has a lso 
been us ed for millen ni a: th e anci ent 
Egyptians sealed their sa rcopha gi 
(stone coffins) with cork, while the 
ancient Greeks and Romans used it 
for anything from beehives to sandals. 

And the cork oak itself is an 
extraordinary tree. Its bark grows 
up to 20 cm in thickness, insulating 
the tree like a coat wrapped around 
the tr unk and br anches and keeping 
th e inside at a constant 20°C all year 
round. Developed most probably as 
a defence against forest fires, th e 
bark of the cork oak has a particular 
cellular structure - with about 
40 million cells per cubic centimetre -
that technology has nev er succeeded 
in re plicatin g . Th e cells are filled with 
air, which is why cork is so buoyant. 
It also has an elasticity that means 
you can squash it and watch it spring 
back to its original size and shape 
when you release the pressure. 

Cork oaks grow in a number of 
Mediterranean countries, including 

Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and 
Morocco. They flourish in warm, sunny 
climates wher e there is a minimum of 
400 millimetres of rain per year, and 
not more than 800 millimetres. Like 
grape vines, th e tre es thrive in poor 
soil, putting down deep roots in search 
of moisture and nutrients. Southern 
Portugal's Alen tejo region m eet s all of 
these requirements, wh ich explains 
why, by the early 20th century, this 
region had become the wor ld 's largest 
producer of cork, and why today it 
accounts for roughly half of all cork 
production around the world. 

Most cork forests are famil y-owned. 
Many of these family businesses , and 
ind eed many of the trees the1nsel ve s, 
are around 200 years old. Cork 
production is , above all, an exercise in 
patience. From the planting of a cork 
sapling to the first harvest takes 25 
years, and a gap of approximately a 
decade must separate harvests from 
an individual tree . And for top-quality 
cork, it's necessary to wait a further 
15 or 20 years . You even have to wait 
for the right kind of summer's da y to 
harvest cork. If the bark is stripped on 
a da y when it's too cold - or when the 
air is damp - the tree will be damaged . 

16 

Reading 

Cork harvesting is a very specialised 
profession. No mechanical means 
of stripping cork bark has been 
invented, so the job is done by teams 
of highly skilled workers . First, they 
make vertical cuts down the bark 
using small sharp axes, then lever · 
it away in pieces as large as they 
can manage. The most skilful cork(cid:173)
strippers prise away a semi-circular 
husk that runs the length of the trunk 
from just above ground level to the 
first branches . It is then dried on the 
ground for about four months, before 
being taken to factories, where it is 
boiled to kill any insects that might 
remain in the cork. Over 60% of 
cork then goes on to be made into 
traditional bottle stopp ers, with m ost 
of the rem a inder being used in the 
constr uction trade . Corkboard an d 
cork t iles ar e id ea l for t hermal an d 
acous t ic insul at ion, wh ile gra nul es of 
cork are us ed in th e manufacture of 
concrete . 

Recent years have seen the end of 
the virtual monopoly of cork as the 
material for bottle stoppers, due to 
concerns about the effect it may have 
on the contents of the bottle . This 

is caused by a chemical compound 
called 2,4,6 -trichloroanisole (TCA), 
which forms through the interaction 
of plant phenols, chlorine and mould . 
The tiniest concentrations - as little 
as three or four parts to a trillion -
can spoil the taste of the product 
contained in the bottle. The result 
has been a gradual yet steady move 
first towards plastic stoppers and, 
more recently , to aluminium screw 
caps. These substitutes are ch eaper to 
manufacture and, in the case of screw 
caps, more convenient for the user . 

The classic cork stopper does 
have several advantages, however. 
Firstly, its traditional image is more 
in keeping with that of the typ e of 
high qualit y goods with which it has 
long b een a ss ociat ed. Secondly -
and very impo r tan t ly - cork is a 
su stain a ble p r odu ct th at can b e 
recy cled witho ut difficulty. Mor eover, 
cor k for es t s a re a resource which 
support local biodiversity, and preven t 
desertification in the regions where 
th ey are planted. So, given the current 
concerns about environmental issues, 
the future of this ancient material 
once again looks promising.

The cork oak has the thickest bark of any living tree. 

Scientists have developed a synthetic cork with the same cellular structure as 
natural cork. 

Individual cork oak trees must be left for 25 years between the first and second 
harvest. 

Cork bark should be stripped in dry atmospheric conditions. 

The only way to remove the bark from cork oak trees is by hand .

COLLECTING 

AS A HOBBY 

C o llec ti ng m ust be one of t he most var ied 
of h uma n act iv ities , a n d it 's one th at many 
o f us ps y cho log ists f in d fasc ina ti ng. M any 
fo rms o f co l lect in g have bee n dig n if ied

wr app er s or whatev er , ta kes t im e , e nergy 
and money t h at could surely b.e p u t t o 
mu c h m o re p rod u ctive use. A nd y et t h e re 
a re mi l l ions o f co l lectors around t he world. 
Wh y do they d o it ? 

Th e re are t h e peop le who col lect beca u se 
th ey w a nt t o m ake money - t hi s could be 
ca l led an instrumen t a l reason for collect ing; 
t h at is, co ll ec t ing as a means t o an end . 
T h ey' ll look for, say, ant iques that t h ey 
can b uy cheap ly and expect to be ab le 
to se ll at a p ro fi t. But t h e re may wel l be a 
psycholog ica l e leme n t, too - buying cheap 
and se lli ng dear ca n g ive th e col lecto r a 
sense of tr iumph . And as sel l ing on l ine is so 
e asy, mor e and more peopl e a re join ing in. 

M any co llectors co llect to dev e lop the i r 
soc ia l l ife, at tend ing m eetings o f a group 
of co llectors and exchang in g information 
on it e ms. This is a var ia nt on j oin ing a 
bridg e club o r a gym , and similar ly brings 
t h em into co nta ct w it h li ke -minded people. 

An o th er mot iv e for co l lect ing is th e d es i re 
t o find so m e thing spec ia l, or a pa rt ic u la r 
examp le of the col lec t ed item, such as a 
rare ea rly rec ord in g by a part ic ul a r s inger . 

Some may spend t heir whole l iv e s in a 
hun t fo r t his . Psyc h ologicall y, t hi s can give 
a pur p ose to a li fe t hat o th e rw ise fee ls 
a im less . The re is a danger , though, 
tha t 
if th e indi v idu a l is ev e r lu c ky enough t o

look ing fo r, rat h er than 
ce le b ra t ing t h e i r success , they m ay fee l 
emp t y, now th at t h e goa l t ha t drove them 
o n has gone. 

If you th ink about collect ing postage 
stamps , another po t e nt ia l reason for 
it - o r, perhaps, a resu lt of co ll ecting - is 
it s ed ucat ion a l va lue . St amp co ll ecting 
opens a w ind ow t o o th er count rie s, and 
to t he p lan t s, an imals, or famous people 
sh ow n on the i r stamps. Simi la rly, in the 
19t h ce nt u ry, many co ll ectors amassed 
foss il s, animals an d plants from around 
the g lobe, and their co ll ections provided 
a v ast amount o f information abo ut th e 
natura l wor ld. Wi t h ou t those co ll ec ti o ns, 
our understanding wou ld be greatly infer ior

operations, or the technical specifications 
of different engine types. 

Similarly, people who collect dolls may go 
beyond simply enlarging their collection, 
and deve lop an interest in the way that 
dolls are made, or the materials that 
are used. These have changed over the 
centuries from the wood that was standard 
in 16th century Europe, through the wax 
and porcelain of later centur ies, to the 
plastics of today's dolls. Or collectors 
might be inspired to study how dolls 
reflect notions of what children like, or 
ought to like. 

perhaps by country in alphabet ica l order, 
or grouping stamps by what they depict(cid:173)
people, birds, maps, and so on. 

One reason, conscious or not, for what 
someone chooses to collect is to show 
the collector's ind ividualism. Someone 
who decides to collect something as 
unexpected as dog collars, for instance, 
may be conveying their belief that they 
must be interesting themselves. And 
believe it or not, there is at least one dog 
collar museum in ex istence, and it grew out 
of a personal collection. 

Not all collectors are interested in learning 
from their hobby, t ho ugh, so wha t we 
might call a psychologica l reason for 
collecting 
is the need for a sense of 
control, perhaps as a way of dealing w ith 
insecurity. Stamp collectors, for instance, 
arrange their stamps in albums, usually very 
neatly, orga ni sing their co llect ion accord in g 
to certain commonp lac e pri ncip les -

Of course, all hobbies give pleasu re, but 
the common factor in collect in g is usually 
passion: pleasure is putting 
it far too 
mi ldly. More than most other hobb ies , 
co llec ting can be totally engrossing, 
and can give a strong sense of personal 
f ulfilment. To non-collec tors it may appear 
an eccen t ric, if harmless, way of spending 
time, but potentially, col lec t ing has a lot 
going for it.

Test5 

What's the purpose of gaining knowledge? 

A 

'I would found an institution where any person can find instruction 
in a ny 
subject.' That was the found er's motto for Cornell University, and it seems an apt 
characterization of the different university, also in rhe USA, where I currently teach 
philosophy. A student can prepare for a career in resort mana gem ent, engi neerin g, 
interior design, accounting, music, law enforc ement, yo u name it. But what would 
the founders of these two in st itution s have thought of a cou rse called 'Arson for Profit'? 
I kid you not: we have it on the books. Any undergr adu ates who have met the academic 
requirements ca n s ign up for the course in our program in 'fire science'. 

B Naturally, the co urse is int end ed for pro sp ective arson in vestigator s, who can learn all 
the tricks of th e trad e for d e tect ing whether a fire was deliberately set, di scove r ing who 
did it, and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law. 
But wouldn't this also b e the perfect course for pro spec tiv e a rso ni sts to sign up for? My 
point is not to criticize academic program s in fire science: they are hi ghly welcome as 
part of the increasii1g profe ssionaliz qtion of thi s and many other occupations. However, 
it 's not unknown for a firefighter to torch a building. 1his examp le su ggests how 
dishone st and illegal behavior, with th e help of. higher ed uc a tion , ca n creep into every 
aspect of publi c and busine ss life. 

C 

I realized this anew when I was invited to spea k before a class in m arketing, which is 
a noth er of our degree pro g rams. The regular in structor is a colleague who appreciates 
th e kind of et hi cal perspective I can brin g as a phil osop h er. There a re endless ways 
I cou ld hav e approac h ed this assignm e nt, but I took my cu e from th e titl e of the 
course: 'Prin c ipl es of Marketing '. It m ade me chink co ask the st udent s, 'ls m ark et in g 
princip led?' After a ll, a subj ect matter can have principles in the sense of being codified, 
havin g rules, as with football or chess, without being principl ed in the sense of being 
e thic al. Many of the students immediately assumed chat the answer co m y question 
ab out marketin g princip les was obvious : no. Just look at th e ways in whi ch every thing 
und er the sun h as b een mark eted; obviously it n eed not be do n e in a p rin cipled 
( =et hic al) fashion . 

D 

Is chat obvious? I mad e the sugges tion, which ma y sou nd downright cra zy in light of 
t h e ev iden ce, that perhaps marketing is by d efinition principled . My in sp ir at ion for this 
judgement 
is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that an y bod y of knowledge 
co n sists of an end (or purpos e) and a means . 

24 

Reading 

E Let us apply both the terms 'means' 
and 'end' to marketing. 
The students 
have signed 
up for a course 
in order to learn how to market effectively
. But to what encP. There seem 
to be two main attitudes 
toward that question. 
One is that the answer is obvious: 
the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is to sell things 
and to make money. The other attitude 
is that the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is irrelevant: 
Each person comes to the 
program 
and course 
with 
his or her own plans, 
and these need not even concern 
the acquisition 
of marketing 
expertise 
as such. My proposal, 
which I believe 
would also be Kane's, 
is that neither 
of 
these attitudes 
captures 
the significance of 
the end to the means for marketing. 
A field 
of knowledge 
or a professional 
endeavor 
is defined 
by both the means and the end; 
hence both deserve 
scrutiny. 
Students 
need to study both how to achieve 
X, and also 
what X is. 

F It is at this point that 'Arson 
for Profit' 
becomes 
supremely 
relevant. 
That course 
is 
presumably 
all about means: how to detect 
and prosecute criminal 
activity. 
It is therefore 
that the end is good in an ethical sense. 
assumed 
When I ask fire science 
students 
to 
articulate 
the end, or purpose, 
of their field, 
they eventually 
generalize 
to something 
like, 
'The safety 
and welfare of society,' which 
seems right. 
As we have seen, someone 
could 
use the very same knowledge 
of means to achieve 
a much less noble end, such as personal 
profit 
via destructive, 
dangerouS', 
reckless activity. 
But we would not call that fire.fightin
g. 
We have a separate 
word for it: arson. 
Similarly, 
if you. employed 
the 'principles 
of 
marketing' 
in an unprincipled 
way, you would not be doing marketing. We have another 
term for it: fraud. Kant gives the example 
of a doctor 
and a poisoner, 
who use the 
identical 
knowledge 
to achieve 
their divergent 
ends. We would say that one is practicing 
medicine, 
the other, 
murder.

Passage 1 below. 

The risks agriculture 
faces in developing 
countries 

Synthesis 
of an online 
debate* 

A Two things distinguish 
food production 
from all other productive 
activities: 
first, 
every single person needs food each day and has a right to it; and second, 
it is 
hugely dependent 
on nature. 
These two unique aspects, 
one political, 
the other 
natural, 
make food production 
highly 
vulnerable 
and different 
from any other 
business. 
At the same time, cultural 
values are highly entrenched 
in food and 
agricultural 
systems worldwide. 

B Farmers everywhere 
face major risks, 
including 
extreme weather, 
long-term 
climate 
change, and price volatility 
in input and product 
markets. 
However, 
smallholder 
farmers 
in developing 
countrie
s must in addition 
deal with adverse 
environments, 
both natural, 
in terms of soil quality, 
rainfall, 
etc., and human, in 
terms of infrastructure, 
financial 
systems, markets, 
knowledge 
and technology. 
Counter-intuitively, 
hunger is prevalent 
among many smallholder 
farmers 
in the 
developing 
world. 

C Participants 
in the online debate argued that our biggest 
challenge 
is to address the 
underlying 
causes of the agricultural 
system's 
inability 
to ensure sufficient 
food for 
all, and they identified 
as drivers 
of this problem our dependency 
on fossil 
fuels and 
unsupportive 
government 
policies. 

D On the question 
of mitigating 
the risks farmers 
face, most essayists 
called for 
greater 
state interventio
n. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President 
of the 
International 
Fund for Agricultural 
Development, 
argued that governments 
can 
significantly 
reduce risks for 
farmers 
by providing 
basic services like 
roads to get 
produce more efficiently 
to markets, 
or water and food 
storage facilities 
to reduce 
losses. 
Sophia Murphy, senior advisor 
to the Institute 
for Agriculture 
and Trade 
Policy, 
suggested 
that the procurement 
and holding 
of stocks by governments 
can also help mitigate 
wild swings in food prices by alleviating 
uncertainties 
about 
market supply.

E Shenggen 
Fan, Director 
General 
of the International 
Food Policy 
Research 
Institute, 
held up social 
safety 
nets and public 
welfare 
programmes 
in Ethiopia, 
Brazil 
and Mexico as valuable 
ways to address 
poverty 
among farming 
families 
and reduce their vulnerability 
to agriculture 
shocks. 
However, 
some commentators 
responded 
that cash transfers 
to poor families 
do not necessarily 
translate 
into 
increased 
food security, as these programmes 
do not always strengthen 
food 
production 
or raise incomes. 
Regarding 
state subsidies 
for agriculture, 
Rokeya 
Kabir, 
Executive 
Director 
of Bangladesh 
Nari Progati 
Sangha, 
commented 
in her 
essay that these 'have not compensated 
for the stranglehold 
exercised 
by private 
traders. 
In fact, studies 
show that sixty percent 
of beneficiaries 
of subsidies 
are not 
poor, but rich landowners 
and non-farmer 
traders.' 

F Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private 
risk management 
tools, 
like private 
insurance, 
commodity 
futures 
markets, 
and rural finance 
can help small-scale 
producers 
mitigate 
risk and allow for investment 
in improvements. 
Kabir warned 
that financial 
support 
schemes often encourage 
the adoption 
of high-input 
agricultural 
practices, 
which in the medium term may raise production 
costs 
beyond the value of their harvests. 
Murphy noted that when futures 
markets 
become excessively 
financialised 
they can contribute 
to short-term 
price volatility, 
which increases 
farmers' 
food insecurity. 
Many participants 
and commentators 
emphasised 
that greater 
transparency 
in markets 
is needed to mitigate 
the impact 
of volatil
ity, and make evident 
whether 
adequate 
stocks and supplies 
are available. 
Others contended 
that agribusiness 
companies 
should be held responsible 
for 
paying for negative 
side effects. 

G Many essayists 
mentioned 
climate 
change and its consequences 
for small-scale 
agriculture. 
Fan explained 
that 'in addition 
to reducing 
crop yields, 
climate 
change 
increases 
the magnitude 
and the frequency 
of extreme 
weather 
events, 
which 
increase 
smallholder 
vulnerabili
ty.' The growing 
unpredictability 
of weather 
patterns 
increases 
farmers' 
difficulty 
in managing 
weather-related 
risks. 
According 
to this 
author, 
one solution 
would be to develop 
crop varieties 
that are more resilient 
to new climate 
trends and extreme 
weather 
patterns. 
Accordingly, 
Pat Mooney, 
co-founder and executive 
director 
of the ETC Group, suggested 
that 'if we are to 
survive 
climate 
change, 
we must adopt policies 
that let peasants 
diversify 
the plant 
and animal species 
and varieties/breeds 
that make up our menus.'

Test 6 

H Some participating 
authors 
and commentators 
argued in favour of community­
based and autonomous 
risk management 
strategies 
through 
collective 
action 
groups, 
co-operatives 
or producers' 
groups. 
Such groups enhance market 
opportunities 
for small-scale 
producers, 
reduce marketing 
costs and synchronise 
buying and selling 
with seasonal 
price conditions. 
According 
to Murphy, 
'collective 
action 
offers 
an important 
way for farmers 
to strengthen 
their political 
and economic 
bargaining 
power, and to reduce their business 
risks.' 
One commentator, 
Giel Ton, 
warned that collective 
action 
does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort 
and money to organise, 
build trust and to experiment. 
Others, 
like Marcel Vernooij 
and Marcel Beukeboom, 
suggested 
that in order to 'apply 
what we already 
know', 
all stakeholders, 
including 
business, 
government, 
scientists 
and civil society, 
must 
work together, 
starting 
at the beginning of 
the value chain. 

Some participants 
explained 
that market price volatility 
is often worsened 
by the 
of intermediary 
purchasers 
who, taking 
advantage 
of farmers' 
vulnerability, 
presence 
dictate 
prices. 
One commentator 
suggested 
farmers 
can gain greater 
control 
over 
prices 
and minimise 
price volatility 
by selling 
directly 
to consumers. 
Similarly, 
Sonali 
Bisht, 
founder 
and advisor 
to the Institute 
of Himalayan Environmental 
Research 
and Education 
(INHERE), 
India, 
wrote that community-supported 
agriculture, 
where 
consumers 
invest 
i'n local 
farmers 
by subscription 
and guarantee 
producers 
a fair 
price, 
is a risk-sharing 
model worth more attention. 
Direct 
food distribution 
systems 
not only encourage 
small-scale 
agriculture 
but also give consumers 
more control 
over the food they consume, 
she wrote.

The Lost City 

An explorer's 
encounter 
with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, 
the most famous 
icon of the Inca civilisation 

A When the US explorer 
and academic 
Hiram Bingham arrived 
in South America 
in 
1911, he was ready for what was to be the greatest 
achievement 
of his life: 
the 
exploration 
of the remote hinterland 
to the west of Cusco, the old capital 
of the Inca 
empire in the Andes mountains 
of Peru. His goal was to locate 
the remains 
of a city 
called 
Vitcos, 
the last capital 
of the Inca civilisation. 
Cusco lies on a high plateau 
at an elevation 
of more than 3,000 metres, 
and Bingham's 
plan was to descend 
from this plateau 
along the valley 
of the Urubamba 
river, 
which takes a circuitous 
route down to the Amazon and passes through 
an area of dramatic 
canyons 
and 
mountain 
ranges. 

B When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba 
in late July, they had 
an advantage 
over travellers 
who had preceded 
them: a track had recently 
been 
blasted 
down the valley 
canyon to enable rubber to be brought 
up by mules from 
the jungle. 
Almost all previous 
traveUers 
had left the river atOllantaytambo 
and 
taken a high pass across the mountains 
'to rejoin 
the river lower down, thereby 
cutting 
a substantial 
corner, 
but also therefore 
never passing 
through 
the area 
around Machu Picchu. 

C On 24 July they were a few days into their descent 
of the valley. 
The day began 
slowly, 
with Bingham trying 
to arrange 
sufficient 
mules for the next stage of the 
trek. His companions 
showed no interest 
in accompanying 
him up the nearby hill 
to see some ruins that a local farmer, 
Melchor 
Arteaga, 
had told them about the 
night before. 
The morning 
was dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have 
been less than keen on the prospect 
of climbing 
the hill. 
In his book Lost City of the 
Incas, 
he relates 
that he made the ascent without 
having the least expectation 
that 
he would find anything 
at the top. 

D Bingham writes 
about the approach 
in vivid style in his book. First, 
as he climbs 
up the hill, 
he describes 
the evet�present 
possibility 
of deadly snakes, 
'capable 
of 
making considerable 
springs 
when in pursuit 
of their prey'; 
not that he sees any. 
Then there's 
a sense of mounting 
discovery 
as he comes -across great sweeps 
of terraces, 
then a mausoleum, 
followed 
by monumental 
staircases 
and, finally, 
the grand ceremonial 
buildings 
of Machu Picchu. 
'It seemed like an unbelievable 
dream ... the sight held me spellbound 
... ' he wrote. 

43 

Test 6 

E We should remember, 
however, 
that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight, 
not written 
until 1948, many years after his journey. 
His journal 
entries 
of the 
time reveal a much more gradual 
appreciation 
of his achievement. 
He spent 
the afternoon 
at the ruins noting down the dimensions 
of some of the buildings, 
then descended 
and rejoined 
his companions, 
to whom he seems to have said 
little 
about his discovery. 
At this stage, Bingham didn't 
realise 
the extent or the 
importance 
of the site, nor did he realise 
what use he could make of the discovery. 

F However, 
soon after returning 
it occurred 
to him that he could make a name for 
from this discovery. 
When he came to write the National 
Geographic 
himself 
magazine 
article 
that broke the story to the world in April 1913, he knew he had 
to produce 
a big idea. He wondered 
whether 
it could have been the birthplace 
of 
the very first 
Inca, Manco the Great, and whether 
it could also have been what 
chroniclers 
described 
as 'the last city of the Incas'. 
This term refers 
to Vilcabamba, 
the settlement 
where the Incas had fled from Spanish 
invaders 
in the 1530s. 
Bingham made desperate 
attempts 
to prove this belief 
for nearly 40 years. Sadly, 
his vision 
of the site as both the beginning 
and end of the Inca civilisation, 
while 
a magnificent 
on.e, is inaccurate. 
We now know that Vilcabamba 
actually 
lies 65 
kilometres 
away in the depths of the jungle. 

G One question 
that has perplexed 
visitors, 
historians 
and archaeologists 
alike ever 
since Bingham, 
is why the site seems to have been abandoned 
before the Spanish 
Conquest. 
There are no references 
to it by any of the Spanish 
chroniclers 
-and if 
they had known of its existence 
so close to Cusco they would certainly 
have come 
in search of gold. An idea which has gained wide acceptance 
over the past few 
years is that Machu Picchu was a moya, a country 
estate built by an Inca emperor 
to escape the cold winters 
of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental 
architecture 
and spectacular 
views. Furthermore, 
the particular 
architecture 
of 
Machu Picchu suggests 
that it was constructed 
at the time of the greatest 
of all the 
Incas, 
the emperor Pachacuti 
(c. 1438-71 
). By custom, 
Pachacuti's 
descendants 
built other similar 
estates 
for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been 
abandoned 
after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish 
Conquest.

The Benefits 
of Being Bilingual 

A According 
to the latest 
figures, 
the majority 
of the world's 
population 
is now bilingual 
or multilingual, 
having grown up speaking 
two or more languages. 
In the past, such 
children 
were considered 
to be at a disadvantage 
compared 
with their monolingual 
peers. Over the past few decades, 
however, technological 
advances 
have allowed 
researchers 
to look more deeply at how bilingualism 
interacts 
with and changes 
the cognitive 
and neurological 
systems, 
thereby 
identifying 
several 
clear benefits 
of 
being bilingual. 

B Research 
shows that when a bilingual 
person uses one language, 
the other is 
active 
at the same time. When we hear a word, we don't hear the entire 
word all at 
once: the sounds arrive 
in sequential 
order. 
Long before the word is finished, 
the 
brain's 
language 
system begins to guess what that word might be. If you hear 'can', 
you will likely 
activate 
words like 'candy' 
and 'candle' 
as werl, at least during the 
earlier 
stages of word recognition. 
For bilingual 
people, 
this activation 
is not limited 
to a single 
language; 
auditory 
input activates 
corresponding 
words regardless 
of the language 
to which they belong. 
Some of the most compelling 
evidence 
for this phenomenon, 
called 
'language 
co-activation', 
comes from studying 
eye 
movements. 
A Russian-English 
bilingual 
asked to 'pick up a marker' 
from a set of 
objects 
would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn't 
know Russian, 
because the Russian 
word for 'stamp', 
marka, sounds like the English 
word he or 
she heard, 'marker'. 
In cases like this, language 
co-activation 
occurs because what 
the listener 
hears could map onto words in either 
language. 

C Having to deal with this persistent 
linguistic 
competition 
can result 
in difficulties, 
however. 
For instance, 
knowing 
more than one language 
can cause speakers 
to 
name pictures 
more slowly, and can increase 
'tip-of-the-tongue 
states', 
when you 
can almost, 
but not quite, 
bring a word to mind. As a result, 
the constant 
juggling 
of 
two languages 
creates 
a need to control 
how much a person accesses 
a language 
at any given time. For this reason, 
bilingual 
people often perform 
better 
on tasks 
that require 
conflict 
management. 
In the classic 
Stroop Task, people see a word 
and are asked to name the colour of the word's font. When the colour and the 
word match (i.e., 
the word 'red' printed 
in red), people correctly 
name the colour 
more quickly 
than when the colour and the word don't match (i.e., 
the word 'red' 
printed 
in blue). 
This occurs because the word itself 
('red') 
and its font colour (blue) 
conflict. 
Bilingual 
people often excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability 
to ignore competing 
perceptual 
information 
and focus on the relevant 
aspects 
of 
the input. 
Bilinguals 
are also better 
at switching 
between two tasks; 
for example, 
when bilinguals 
have to switch from categorizing 
objects 
by colour (red or green) 

46 

Reading 

to ·categorizing 
them by shape (circle 
or triangle), 
they do so more quickly 
than 
monolingual 
people, 
reflecting 
better 
cognitive 
control 
when having to make rapid 
cl1anges of strategy. 

D It also seems that the neurological 
roots of the bilingual 
advantage 
extend to brain 
ar-eas more traditionally 
associated 
with sensory 
processing. 
When monolingual 
and bilingual 
adolescents 
listen 
to simple speech sounds without 
any intervening 
background 
noise, 
they show highly 
similar 
brain stem responses. 
When 
researchers 
play the same sound to both groups in the presence 
of background 
noise, 
however, 
the bilingual 
listeners' 
neural 
response 
is considerably 
larger, 
reflecting 
better 
encoding 
of the sound's 
fundamental 
frequenc
y, a feature 
of sound 
closely 
related 
to pitch perception. 

E Such improvements 
in cognitive 
and sensory 
processing 
may help a bilingual 
person to process 
information 
in the environment, 
and help explain 
why bilingual 
adults 
acquire 
a third language 
better 
than monolingual 
adults 
master a second 
language. 
This advantage 
may be rooted in the skill 
of focussing 
on information 
about the new language 
while reducing 
interference 
from the languages 
they 
al ready know. 

F Research 
also indicates 
that bilingual 
experience 
may help to keep the cognitive 
mechanisms 
sharp by recruiting 
alternate 
brain networks 
to compensate 
for those 
that become damaged during 
aging. 
Older bilinguals 
enjoy improved 
memory 
relative 
to monolingual 
people, 
which can lead to real-world 
health 
benefits. 
In a 
study of over 200 patients 
with Alzheimer's 
disease, 
a degenerative 
brain disease, 
bilingual patients 
reported 
showing 
initial 
symptoms 
of the disease 
an average 
of five years later than monolingual 
patients. 
In a follow-up 
study, researchers 
compared 
the brains 
of bilingual 
and monolingual 
patients 
matched on the severity 
of Alzheimer's 
symptoms. 
Surprisingly, 
the bilinguals' 
brains 
had more physical 
signs of disease 
than their monolingual 
counterparts, 
even though their outward 
behaviour 
and abilities 
were the same. If the brain is an engine, 
bilingualism 
may 
help it to go farther 
on the same amount of fuel. 

G Furthermore, 
the benefits 
associated 
with bilingual 
experience 
seem to start 
very early. In one study, 
researchers 
taught 
seven-month-old 
babies growing 
up·in monolingual 
or bilingual 
homes that when they heard a tinkling 
sound, a 
puppet appeared 
on one side of a screen. 
Halfway 
through 
the study, 
the puppet 
began appearing 
on the opposite 
side of the screen. 
In order to get a reward, 
the 
infants 
had to adjust 
the rule they'd 
learned; 
only the bilingual 
babies were able to 
successfully 
learn the new rule. This suggests 
that for very young children, 
as well 
as for older people, 
navigating 
a multilingual 
environment 
imparts 
advantages 
that 
transfer 
far beyond language.

Flying tortoises 

An airborne 
reintroduction 
programme 
has helped conservationists 
take 
significant 
steps to protect 
the endangered 
Galapagos tortoise. 

A Forests 
of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains 
that separate 
the 
of the Galapagos 
island 
of lsabela 
from the Pacific 
Ocean. With its 
interior 
five distinct volcanoes, the 
island 
resembles 
a lunar landscape. 
Only the thick 
vegetation 
at the skirt of the often cloud-covered 
peak of Sierra Negra offers 
respite 
from the barren terrain below. 
This inhospitable 
environment 
is home to the giant 
Galapagos 
tortoise. Some 
time after the Galapagos's 
birth, 
around five 
million 
y ears ago, the islands 
were colonised 
by one or more tortoises 
from mainland 
South America. 
As these ancestral 
tortoises 
settled 
on the individual 
islands, 
the 
different 
populations adapted 
to their unique environments, 
giving 
rise to at least 
14 different subspecies. 
Island 
life agreed with them. In the absence of significant 
predators, 
they grew to become the largest 
and longest-living 
tortoises 
on the 
planet, 
weighing 
more than 400 kilograms, 
occasionally 
exceeding 
1.8 metres in 
length and living 
for more than a century. 

8 Before human arrival, 
the archipelago's 
tortoises 
numbered 
in the hundreds 
of thousands. 
From the 17th century 
onwards, 
pirates 
took a few on board for 
food, but the arrival 
of whaling 
ships in the 1790s saw this exploitation 
grow 
exponentially. 
Relatively 
immobile 
and capable 
of surviving 
for months without food 
or water, the tortoises 
were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies 
during long ocean passages. 
Sometimes, 
their bodies were processed 
into high­
grade oil. In total, 
an estimated 
200,000 animals 
were taken from the archipelago 
before the 20th century. 
This historical 
exploitation 
was then exacerbated 
when 
settlers 
came to the islands. 
They hunted the tortoises 
and destroyed 
their habitat 
to clear land for agriculture. 
They also introduced 
alien species 
-ranging 
from 
cattle, 
pigs, goats, rats and dogs to plants and ants -that either 
prey on the eggs 
and young tortoises 
or damage or destroy 
their habitat. 

C Today, only 11 of the original 
subspecies 
survive 
and of these, several 
are highly 
endangered. 
In 1989, work began on a tortoise-breeding 
centre just outside 
the 
town of Puerto Villamil 
on lsabela, 
dedicated 
to protecting 
the island's 
tortoise 
populations. 
The centre's 
captive-breeding 
programme 
proved to be extremely 
successful, 
and it eventually 
had to deal with 
an overpopulation 
problem. 

D The problem 
was also a pressing 
one. Captive-bred 
tortoises 
can't be reintroduced 
into the wild until they're 
at least five years old and weigh at least 4.5 kilograms, 
at which point their size and weight -and their hardened 
shells 
-are sufficient 
to protect 
them from predators. 
But if people wait too long after that point, 
the 
tortoises 
eventually 
become too large to transport. 

60 

Reading 

E For years, repatriation 
efforts 
were carried 
out in small numbers, 
with the tortoises 
carried 
on the backs of men over weeks of long, treacherous 
hikes along narrow 
trails. 
But in November 
2010, the environmentalist 
and Galapagos 
National 
Park 
liaison 
officer 
Godfrey 
Merlin, 
a visiting 
private 
motor yacht captain 
and a helicopter 
pilot gathered 
around a table in a small cafe in Puerto Ayora on the island 
of Santa 
Cruz to work out more ambitious 
reintroduction. 
The aim was to use a helicopter 
to move 300 of the breeding 
centre's 
tortoises 
to various 
locations 
close to Sierra 
Negra. 

F This unprecedented 
effort 
was made possible 
by the owners of the 67-metre 
yacht White Cloud, who provided 
the Galapagos 
National 
Park with free use of 
their helicopter 
and its experienced 
pilot, 
as well as the logistical 
support 
of the 
yacht, its captain 
and crew. Originally 
an air ambulance, 
the yacht's 
helicopter 
has a rear double door and a large internal 
space that's 
well suited 
for cargo, 
so a custom crate was designed 
to hold up to 33 tortoises 
with a total weight of 
about 150 kilograms. 
This weight, 
together 
with that of the fuel, pilot and four crew, 
approached 
the helicopter's 
maximum payload, 
and there were times when it was 
clearly 
right on the edge of the helicopter's 
capabilities. 
During a period of three 
days, a group of volunteers 
from the breeding 
centre worked around the clock to 
prepare 
the young tortoises 
for transport. 
Meanwhile, 
park wardens, 
dropped 
off 
ahead of time in remote locations, 
cleared 
landing 
sites within 
the thick brush, cacti 
and lava rocks. 

G Upon their release, 
the juvenile 
tortoises 
quickly 
spread out over their ancestral 
territory, investigating 
their new surroundings 
and feeding 
on the vegetation. 
Eventually, 
one tiny tortoise 
came across a fully grown giant who had been 
lumbering 
around the island 
for around a hundred years. The two stood side by 
side, a powerful 
symbol of the regeneration 
of an ancient 
species.

The Intersection 
of Health Sciences 
and Geography 

A While many diseases 
that affect 
humans have been eradicated 
due to 
improvements 
in vaccinations 
and the availability 
of healthcare, 
there are still 
areas 
around the world where certain 
health issues are more prevalent. 
In a world that is 
far more globalised 
than ever before, 
people come into contact 
with one another 
through 
travel 
and living 
closer 
and closer to each other. 
As a result, 
super-viruses 
and other infections 
resistant 
to antibiotics 
are becoming 
more and more common. 

B Geography 
can often play a very large role in the health concerns 
of certain 
populations. 
For instance, 
depending 
on where you live, you will not have the same 
health concerns 
as someone who lives in a different 
geographical 
region. 
Perhaps 
one of the most obvious 
examples 
of this idea is malaria-prone 
areas, which are 
usually 
tropical 
regions 
that foster 
a warm and damp environment 
in which the 
mosquitos 
that can give people this disease 
can grow. Malarip 
is much less of a 
problem 
in high-altitude 
deserts, 
for instance. 

C In some countries, 
geographical 
factors 
influence 
the health and well-being 
of 
the population 
in very obvious 
ways. In many large cities, 
the wind is not strong 
enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution 
that cause 
asthma, 
lung problems, 
eyesight 
issues and more in the people who live there. 
Part 
of the problem 
is, of course, 
the massive number of cars being driven, 
in addition 
to factories 
that run on coal power. The rapid industrialisation 
of some countries 
in 
recent years has also led to the cutting 
down of forests 
to allow for the expansion 
of 
big cities, 
which makes it even harder to fight the pollution 
with the fresh air that is 
produced 
by plants. 

D It is in situations 
like these that the field of health geography 
comes into its own. It 
is an increasingly 
important 
area of study in a world where diseases 
like polio are 
re-emerging,-
respiratory 
diseases 
continue 
to spread, 
and malaria-prone 
areas 
are still 
fighting 
to find a better 
cure. Health geography 
is the combination 
of, on 
the one hand, knowledge 
regarding 
geography 
and methods used to analyse 
and -­
interpret 
geographical 
information, 
and on the other, 
the study of health, 
diseases 
and healthcare 
practices 
around the world. The aim of this hybrid science 
is to 
create solutions 
for common geography-based 
health problems. 
While people will 
always be prone to illness, 
the study of how geography 
affects 
our health could 
lead to the eradication 
of certain 
illnesses, 
and the prevention 
of others in the 
future. 
By understanding 
why and how we get sick, we can change the way we 
treat illness 
and disease 
specific 
to certain 
geographical 
locations. 

63 

Test 7 

E The geography 
of disease 
and ill health analyses 
the frequency 
with which certain 
diseases 
appear in different 
parts of the world, and overlays 
the data with the 
geography 
of the region, 
to see if there could be a correlation 
between the two. 
Health geographers 
also study factors 
that could make certain 
individuals 
or a 
population 
more likely 
to be taken ill with a specific 
health concern 
or disease, 
as 
compared 
with the population 
of another 
area. Health geographers 
in this field 
are usually 
trained 
as healthcare 
workers, 
and have an understanding 
of basic 
epidemiology 
as it relates 
to the spread of diseases 
among the population. 

F Researchers 
study the interactions 
between humans and their environment 
that 
could lead to illness 
(such as asthma in places with high levels 
of pollution) 
and 
work to create a clear way of categorising 
illnesses, 
diseases 
and epidemics 
into 
local and global 
scales. 
Health geographers 
can map the spread of illnesses 
and 
attempt 
to identify 
the reasons 
behind an increase 
or decrease 
in illnesses, 
as 
they work to find a way to halt the further 
spread or re-emergence 
of diseases 
in 
vulnerable 
populations. 

G The second subcategory 
of health geography 
is the geography 
of healthcare 
provision. 
This group studies 
the availability 
(or lack thereof) 
of healthcare 
resources 
to individuals 
and populafrons 
around the world. In both developed 
and 
developing 
nations 
there is often a very large discrepancy 
between the options 
available 
to people in different 
social 
classes, 
income brackets, 
and levels 
of 
education. 
Individuals 
working 
in the area of the geography 
of healthcare 
provision 
attempt 
to assess the levels 
of healthcare 
in the area (for instance, 
it may be very 
difficult 
for people to get medical 
attention 
because there is a mountain 
between 
their village 
and the nearest 
hospital). 
These researchers 
are on the frontline 
of 
making recommendations 
regarding 
policy 
to international 
organisations, 
local 
government 
bodies and others. 

H The field of health geography 
is often overlooked, 
but it constitutes 
a huge area 
of need in the fields 
of geography 
and healthcare. 
If we can understand 
how 
geography 
affects 
our health no matter where in the world we are located, 
we can 
better 
treat disease, 
prevent 
illness, 
and keep people safe and well.

Music and the emotions 

Neuroscientist 
Jonah Lehrer considers 
the emotional 
power of music 

Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, 
music is a purely abstract 
art form, 
devoid of language 
or explicit 
ideas. 
And yet, even though music says little, 
it still 
manages to touch us deeply. When listening 
to our favourite 
songs, our body betrays 
all 
the symptoms 
of emotional 
arousal. 
The pupils 
in our eyes dilate, our 
pulse and blood 
pressure 
rise, the electrical 
conductance 
of our skin is lowered, 
and the cerebellum, 
a 
brain region associated 
with bodily 
movement, 
becomes strangely 
active. 
Blood is even 
re-directed 
to the 
muscles 
in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological 
roots. 

A recent paper in Nature Neuroscience 
by a research 
team in Montreal, 
Canada, marks 
an important 
step in revealing 
the precise 
1.mderpinnings 
of 'the potent pleasurable 
stimulus' 
that is music. Although 
the study involves 
plenty 
of fancy technology, 
including 
functional 
magnetic resonance 
imaging 
(fMRI) and ligand-based 
positron 
emission 
tomography 
(PET) scanning, 
the experiment 
itself 
was rather straightforward. 
After 
screening 
217 individuals 
who responded 
to advertisements 
requesting 
people who 
experience 
'chills' 
to instrumental 
music, the scientists 
narrowed 
down the subject 
pool 
to ten. They then asked the subjects 
to bring in their playlist 
of favourite 
songs -virtually 
every genre was represented, 
from techno to tango -and played them the music while 
their brain activity 
was monitored. 
Because the scientists 
were combining 
methodologies 
(PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively 
exact and detailed 
portrait 
of 
music in the brain. 
The first 
thing they discovered 
is that music triggers 
the production 
of dopamine 
- a chemical 
with a key role in setting 
people's 
moods -by the neurons 
(nerve cells) 
in both the dorsal and ventral 
regions 
of the brain. 
As these two regions 
have long been linked 
with the experience 
of pleasure, 
this finding 
isn't particularly 
surprising. 

What is rather 
more significant 
is the finding 
that the dopamine 
neurons 
in the 
caudate 
- a region of the brain involved 
in learning 
stimulus-response 
associations, 
and in anticipating 
food and other 'reward' 
stimuli 
-were at their most active 
around 
15 seconds before the participants' 
favourite 
moments in the music. The researchers 
call this the 'anticipatory 
phase' and argue that the purpose 
of this activity 
is to help 
us predict 
the arrival 
of our 
favourite 
part. The question, 
of course, 
is what all these 
dopamine 
neurons are up 
to. Why are they so 
active 
in the period preceding 
the 
acoustic 
climax? After all, 
we typically 
associate surges 
of dopamine 
with pleasure, 
with 
the processing 
of actual 
rewards. 
And yet, this cluster 
of cells is most active 
when the 
'chills' have yet 
to arrive, 
when the melodic 
pattern 
is still 
unresolved. 

66 

Reading 

One way to answer the question 
is to look at the music and not the neurons. 
While 
music can often seem (at least to the outsider) 
like a labyrinth 
of intricate 
patterns, 
it 
turns out that the most important 
part of every song or symphony 
is when the patterns 
break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. 
If the music is too obvious, 
it is 
annoyingly 
boring, 
like an alarm clock. 
Numerous 
studies, 
after all, have demonstrated 
that dopamine 
neurons 
quickly 
adapt to predictable 
rewards. 
If we know what's going 
to happen next, then we don't get excited. 
This is why composers 
often introduce 
a 
key note in the beginning 
of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious 
avoidance 
of the pattern, 
and then finally 
repeat it only at the end. The longer 
we are 
denied the pattern 
we expect, 
the greater 
the emotional 
release 
when the pattern 
returns, 
safe and sound. 

To demonstrate 
this psychological 
principle, 
the musicologist 
Leonard 
Meyer, in his 
book Emotion 
and Meaning in Music (1956), 
analysed 
the 5th movement 
of 
classic 
Beethoven's 
String 
Quartet 
in C-sharp 
minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how 
music is defined 
by its flirtation 
with -but not submission 
to -our expectations 
of order. 
Meyer dissected 
50 measures 
(bars) 
of the masterpiece, 
showing 
how Beethoven 
begins with the clear statement 
of a rhythmic 
and harmonic 
pattern 
and then, in an 
ingenious 
tonal dance, carefully 
holds off repeating 
it. What Beethoven 
does instead 
is 
suggest 
variations 
of th� pattern. 
He wants to preserve 
an element 
of uncertainty 
in his 
music, making our brains 
beg for the one chord he refuses 
to give us. Beethoven 
saves 
that chord for the end. 

According 
to Meyer, it is the suspenseful 
tension 
of music, arising 
out of our unfulfilled 
expectations, 
that is the source of the music's 
feeling. 
While earlier 
theories 
of music 
focused 
on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences 
-its 
'connotative' 
meaning 
-Meyer argued that the emotions 
we find in music come from the 
unfolding 
events of the music itself. 
This 'embodied 
meaning' 
arises 
from the patterns 
the symphony 
invokes 
and then ignores. 
It is this uncertainty 
that triggers 
the surge 
of dopamine 
in the caudate, 
as we struggle 
to figure 
out what will happen next. We 
can predict 
some of the notes, 
but we can't predict 
them all, and that is what keeps us 
listening, 
waiting 
expectantly 
for our reward, 
for the pattern 
to be completed.

UK companies 
need more effective 
boards of directors 

A After a number of serious 
failures 
of governance 
(that is, how they are managed 
at the highest 
level), 
companies 
in Britain, 
as well as elsewhere, 
should consider 
radical 
changes 
to their directors' 
roles. 
It is clear that the role of a board director 
today is not an easy one. Following 
the 2008 financial 
meltdown, 
which resulted 
in 
a deeper and more prolonged 
period 
of economic 
downturn 
than anyone expected, 
the search for explanations 
in the many post-mortems 
of the crisis 
has meant 
blame has been spread far and wide. Governments, 
regulators, 
central 
banks and 
auditors 
have all been in the frame. The role of bank directors 
and management 
and their widely publicised 
failures 
have been extensively 
picked over and 
examined 
in reports, 
inquiries 
and commentaries. 

B The knock-on 
effect of this scrutiny 
has been to make the governance 
of 
companies 
in general 
an issue of intense 
public 
debate and has significantly 
increased 
the pressures 
on, and the responsibilities 
of, directors. 
At the simplest 
and most practical 
level, 
the time involved 
in fulfilling 
the demands of a board 
directorship 
has increased 
signific
antly, calling 
into question 
the effectiveness 
of 
the classic 
model of corporate 
governance 
by part-time, 
independent 
non-executive 
directors. 
Where once a board schedule 
may have consisted 
of between 
eight and 
ten meetings 
a year, in many companies 
the number of events requiring 
board 
input and decisions 
has dramatically 
risen. 
Furthermore, 
the amount of reading 
and preparation 
required 
for each meeting 
is increasing. 
Agendas can become 
overloaded 
and this can mean the time for constructive 
debate must necessarily 
be 
restricted 
in favour of getting 
through 
the business. 

C Often, board business 
is devolved 
to committees 
in order to cope with the 
workload, 
which may be more efficient 
but can mean that the board as a whole 
is less involved 
in fully addressing 
some of the most important 
issues. 
It is not 
uncommon for the audit committee 
meeting 
to last longer 
than the main board 
meeting 
itself. 
Process 
may take the place of discussion 
and be at the expense 
of 
real collaboration, 
so that boxes are ticked 
rather 
than issues 
tackled. 

D A radical 
solution, 
which may work for some very large companies 
whose 
businesses 
are extensive 
and complex, 
is the professional 
board, whose members­
would work up to three or four days a week, supported 
by their own dedicated 
staff 
and advisers. 
There are obvious 
.. risks to this-and it would be important 
to establish 
clear guidelines 
for such a board to ensure that it did not step on the toes of 
management 
by becoming 
too engaged in the day-to-day 
running 
of the company. 
Problems 
of recruitment, 
remuneration 
and independence 
could also arise and this 
structure 
would not be appropriate 
for all companies. 
However, 
more professional 
and better-inf
ormed boards would have been particularly 
appropriate 
for banks 
had access to information 
where the executives 
that part-time 
non-executive 
directors 
lacked, 
leaving 
the latter 
unable to comprehend 
or anticipate 
the 2008 
crash. 

89 

Test 8 

E One of the main criticisms 
of boards and their directors 
is that they do not focus 
sufficiently 
on longer-term 
matters 
of strategy, 
sustainability 
and governance, 
but instead 
concentrate 
too much on short-term 
financial 
metrics. 
Regulatory 
requirements 
and the structure 
of the market encourage 
this behaviour. 
The tyranny 
of quarterly 
reporting 
can distort 
board decision-making, 
as directors 
have to 'make 
the numbers' 
every four months to meet the insatiable 
appetite 
of the market for 
more data. This serves to encourage 
the trading 
methodology 
of a certain 
kind of 
investor 
who moves in and out of a stock without 
engaging 
in constructive 
dialogue 
with the company about strategy 
or performance, 
and is simply seeking 
a short­
term financial 
gain. This effect 
has been made worse by the changing 
profile 
of 
investors 
due to the globalisation 
of capital 
and the increasing 
use of automated 
trading 
systems. 
Corporate 
culture 
adapts and management 
teams are largely 
incentivised 
to meet financial 
goals. 

F Compensation 
for chief executives 
has become a combat zone where pitched 
battles 
between investors, 
management 
and board members are fought, 
often 
behind closed doors but increasingly 
frequently 
in the full glare of press attention. 
Many would argue that this is in the interest 
of transparency 
and good governance 
as shareholders 
use their muscle in, the area of pay to pressure 
boards to 
remove underperforming 
chief executives. 
Their powers to vote down executive 
remuneration 
policies 
increased 
when binding 
votes came into force. 
The chair 
of the remuneration 
committee 
can be an exposed and lonely 
role, as Alison 
Carnwath, 
chair of Barclays 
Bank's remuneration 
committee, 
found when she had 
to resign, 
having been roundly 
criticised 
for trying 
to defend the enormous 
bonus 
to be paid to the chief executive; 
the irony being that she was widely understood 
to 
have spoken out against 
it in the privacy 
of the committee. 

G The financial 
crisis 
stimulated 
a debate about the role and purpose 
of the company 
and a heightened 
awareness 
of corporate 
ethics. 
Trust in the corporation 
has been 
eroded and academics 
such as Michael 
Sandel, 
in his thoughtful 
and bestselling 
book What Money Can't Buy, are questioning 
the morality 
of capitalism 
and the 
market economy. Boards of companies 
in all sectors 
will need to widen their 
perspective 
to encompass 
these issues and this may involve 
a realignment 
of 
corporate 
goals. 
We live in challenging 
times.

that Example 

TC EMPLOYEE: 
Hi. Can I help you? 
vIsITOR: I'd like to find out if you have any excursions 
suitable 
for families. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. How about taking 
your family 
for a cruise? 
We have a steamship 
takes passengers 
out several 
times a day -it's over 100 years old. 
VISITOR: That sounds interesting. 
How long is the trip? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
About an hour and a half. And don't forget 
to take pictures 
of the mountains. 
01 
They're 
all around you when you're 
on the boat and they look fantastic. 
vIsIToR: OK. And I assume there's 
a cafe or something 
on board? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. How old are your children? 
vIs1TOR: Er, my daughter's 
fifteen 
and my son's seven. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Right. 
Well there are various 
things 
you can do once you've crossed 
the lake, 
to make a day of it. One thing that's 
very popular 
is a visit 
to the Country 
Farm. 
You're 
met off the boat by the farmer and he'll 
take you to the holding 
pens, 
where the sheep are kept. Children 
love feeding 
them! 
vIsITOR: My son would love that. He really 
likes animals. 
Tc EMPLOYEE: 
Well, there's 
also a 40-minute 
trek round the farm on a horse, 
if he wants. 02 
vIsIToR: Do you think he'd manage it? He hasn't 
done that before. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. It's suitable 
for complete 
beginners. 
vIsITOR: Ah, good. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
And again, 
visitors 
are welcome to explore 
the farm on their own, as long 
as th�y take care to close gates and so on. There are some very beautiful 03 
gardens 
along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm -they'll 
be 
just at their best now. You could easily 
spend an hour or two there. 
vIsITOR: OK. Well that all sounds good. And can we get lunch there? 
04 
You can, and it's very good, though it's not included 
in the basic cost. You pay 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
when you get there. 
VISITOR: Right. 

vIsITOR: So is there anything 
else to do over on that side of the lake? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling 
tril?'. There's 
a _trail 
ther.e 
called 
the Back �oad -: you could ea?ily 
spen_9 
three 
or four hours exploring 
it, and the scenery's 
wonderful. 
They'll 
give you a map 05 
when you get your ticket 
for the cruise 
-there's 
no extra charge. 
vIsITOR: What's the trail 
like in terms of difficulty? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Quite challenging 
in places. 
It wouldn't 
be suitable 
for your seven-year-old. 
lL 06 
needs someone who's got a bit more experience. 
v1sITOR: Hmm. Well, my daughter 
loves cycling 
and so do I, so maybe the two of us 
could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm. That might work out 
quite well. But we don't have bikes here ... is there somewhere 
we could 
rent them? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Yes, there's 
a place here in the city. 
It's called 
Ratchesons. 
vIsITOR: I'll just make a note of that -er, how do you spell it? 

07

Audioscripts 

TC EMPLOYEE: 
R-A-T-C-H-E-S-O-N-S. 
It's just by the cruise ship terminal.
VISITOR: OK. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
You'd also need to pick up a repair 
kit for the bike from there to take along 
with 
you, and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -it'd be best to get 
those in the city. 
vIsIToR: Fine. That shouldn't 
be a problem. 
And I assume I can rent a helmet from the QB 
bike place? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure, you should definitely 
get that. It's a great ride, but you want to be well 
prepared 
because it's very remote -you won't see any shops round there, 
or Q9 
anywhere 
to stay. so you need to get back in time for the last boat. 
vIsITOR: Yeah. So what sort of prices 
are we looking 
at here? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Let's see, that'd 
be one adult and one child for the cruise 
with farm tour, 
that's 
$117, and an adult and a child for the cruise 
only so that's $214 
dollars 
altogether. 
Oh, wait a minute, 
how old did you say your daughter 
was? 
VISITOR: Fifteen. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Then I'm afraid it's 
$267 because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75 Q10 
instead 
of the child fare which is $22 -sorry about that. 
vIsITOR: That's OK. Er, so how do ... 

SECTION 2 

Good morning 
everyone. 
My name's Joy Parkins 
and I'm the restaurant 
manager. 
And I 
understand 
that none of you've had any previous 
experience 
as kitchen 
assistants? 
Well, 
you might be feeling 
a bit nervous 
now, but most of our kitchen assistants 
say they enjoy the 
work. OK, they might get shouted 
at sometimes, 
but it's nothing 
personal, 
and they're 
pleased 
that they have so many different 
things to do, which means they never get bored. And I'll 
tell you straightaway 
that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving 
you 
some more responsibility. 

Q11 

Right, 
well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent 
start. 
Now I'm glad to see none 
of you have unsuitable 
footwear, 
so that's good 
-you need to be careful 
as the floors 
can get 
very wet and slippery. 
Those of you with long hair 
have got it well out of the way, but some 
of 
you'll 
need to remove your rings and bracelets 
-just put them somewhere 
safe for today, and 
remember 
to leave them at home tomorrow, as 
they can be a safety 
hazard. 

Q12 

Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -we don't have any tables 
free for this 
evening, 
and only a few for lunch. Fortunately 
we've got our Head Chef back -he was away 
on holiday 
all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work. Now, I'll tell you a bit 
more about the job in a minute but first, 
some general 
regulations. 
For all of you, whatever 
your age, there's 
some equipment 
you mustn't 
use until you've been properly 
trained, like 
the waste disposal system 
for example, 
for health and safety reasons. 
Then I think there are 
two of you here who are 
under 18 -that's 
Emma and Jake, isn't it? Right. 
so for you two, the 
meat slicer 
is out of bounds. 
And of course none of you are allowed 
to use the electric 
mixer 
until you've been shown how it works. 

Q13 

Q14 

Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful 
job, and I have to say that can be true. 
be working 
an eight-hour 
day for the first 
week, though you'll 
have the chance to do 
You'll 
overtime 
after that 
as well if you want to. But however long the hours 
are, you'll 
get a break 
in the middle. 
What you will find is that you're 
on your feet all day long, lifting 
and carrying, 
so 
if you're not fit now you soon will be! You'll find 
you don't have 
much chance to take it easy -
when someone tells you to do something 
you need to do it straightaway 
-but at least we do 
have a very efficient 
air conditioning 
system compared 
with some kitchens. 

Q16 

Q15 & 

96 

Tests 

Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know. So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins Q17
and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for. 
I'll be trying 
to get 
you to work with as many different people 
in the kitchen 
as possible, 
so that you learn while 
you're 
on the job. One person whose name you must remember 
is David Field. 
If you injure Q18
yourself 
at all, even if it's really 
minor, 
you must report 
to him and he'll make sure the incident 
is recorded 
and you get the appropriate treatment. 
He's trained 
to give basic treatment 
to 
staff himself, 
or he'll send 
you off somewhere 
else if necessary. 
Then there's 
Dexter Wills 
he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something 
like that. Don't just leave 
it and hope no one will notice 
-it's really 
important 
to get things 
noted and replaced 
or there 
could be problems 
later. 
And finally, 
there's 
Mike Smith. He's the member of staff who takes Q20
care of all the stores 
of perishables. 
so if you notice 
we're getting 
low in flour or sugar or 
something. 
make sure you let him know so he can put 
in an order. 

- Q19

OK, now the next thing ... 

SECTION 3 

TRUDIE: OK, Stewart. 
We need to start planning 
our paper on public 
libraries. 
Have you 
thought 
of an angle yet? 
STEWART: Well, there's 
so much we could look into. How libraries 
have changed 
over the 
centuries, 
for instance, 
or how different 
countries 
organise 
them. What do you
think, 
Trudie? 
TRUDIE: Maybe we should concentrate 
on.this country, 
and try and relate 
the changes 
libraries 
to external 
developments. 
like the fact that far 
more people can read than 
a century ago, and that the local population 
may speak lots of different 
languages. 
STEWART: We could include 
something 
about changes 
in the source of funding, 
too. 
TRUDIE: Yes, but remember 
we're only supposed 
to write a short paper, 
so it's probably 
best if we don't go into funding 
in any detail. 
Well, shall we just brainstorm 
a few ideas, 
to get started? 
TRUDIE: OK. We obviously 
need to look at the impact of new technology, 
particularly 
the 
internet. 
Now that lots of books have been digitalised, 
people can access them 
from their own computers 
at home. 
STEWART: And if everyone 
did that, libraries 
would be obsolete. 

STEWART: Right. 

in Q21 

TRUDIE: Yes. 

Q22 

TRUDIE: That's 

STEWART: But the digitalised 
books that are available 
on line for free are mostly out of 
copyright. 
aren't 
they? And copyright 
in this country lasts for 70 years after the 
author dies. So you won't find the latest 
best-seller 
or up-to-date 
information. 
an important 
point.Aoyway, 
I findit_hard
_to • .concentrate 
when I'm.reading 
a 
long text on a screen. 
I'd much rather 
read a physical 
book. And it takes longer 
to 
read on a screen. 
STEWART: Oh, I prefer 
it. I suppose 
it's just a personal 
preference. 
TRUDIE: Mm. I expect that libraries 
will go on evolving 
in the next few years. 
Some have 
already 
become centres 
where community 
activities 
take place, 
like local clubs 
meeting 
there. 
I think that'll 
become even more common. 
STEWART: I'd like to think so, and that they'll 
still 
be serving 
their traditional 
function, 
but I'm 
not so sure. There are financial 
implications, 
after all. What I'm afraid 
will happen is Q23
that books and magazines 
will all disappear. 
and there'll 
just be rows and rows of 
computers. 
They won't look anything 
like the libraries we're 
used to. 
TRUDIE: Well, we'll see. 

97 

Audioscripts 

TRUDIE: Right. 

TRUDIE: I've just had an idea. Why don't we make an in-depth 
study of our local public 
library 
as background 
to our paper? 
STEWART: Yes, that'd 
be interesting, 
and raise all sorts of issues. 
Let's make a list of possible 
things 
we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure. 
For instance, 
um. Q24
we could interview 
some of the staff, 
and find out whether 
the library 
has its own 
budget, 
or if that's 
controlled 
by the local council. 
TRUDIE: And what their policies 
are. I know they don't allow food, but I'd love to find out 
what types of noise they ban -there always seems to 
be a lot of talking, 
but never 
music. I don't know if that's 
a policy 
or it just happens. 
STEWART: Ah, I've often 
wondered. 
Then there are things 
like how the library 
is affected 
by Q25 
employment 
laws. I suppose there are rules about working 
hours, facilities for 
staff, 
and so on. 
Then there are other issues relating 
to the design of the building 
and how Q26 
customers use 
it. Like what measures does the 
library 
take to ensure their safety? 
They'd need floor coverings 
that aren't 
slippery, 
and emergency exits, 
for instance. 
Oh, and another 
thing -there's 
the question 
of the kind of insurance 
the library Q27
needs to have, in case anyone gets injured. 
STEWART: Yes, that's 
something 
else to find out. You know something 
I've often wondered? 
TRUDIE What's that? 
STEWART: Well, you know they've 
got an archive 
of local newspapers 
going back years? Well, 
next to it they've 
got the diary of a well-known 
politician 
from the late 19th century. 
I wonder why it's there. 
Do you know what his con_nection 
was with this area? 
TRUDIE: No idea. Let's add it to our list of things 
to find out. Oh., I've just thought 
-you know Q29
people might ask in the iibrary 
about local organisations, 
lik� sports clubs? Well. I 
wonder if they keep a database, 
or whether 
they just look online. 
I quite fancy finding 
out what the differences 
are between a library 
that's Q30
open to the public 
and one that's 
part of a museum, for example -they must be 
very different. 
TRUDIE: Mmm. Then something 
else I'd like to know is ... 

STEWART: Right. 

Q28

SECTION 4 

In public 
discussion 
of business, 
we take certain 
values for granted. 
Today I'm going to talk 
about four of them: collaboration, 
hard work, creativity 
and excellence. 
Most people would 
say they're 
all 'good things'. 
I'm going to suggest 
that's 
an over-simple 
view. 

The trouble with these 
values is that they're 
theoretical 
concepts, 
removed from the reality 
of 
day-to-day 
business. 
Pursue values by all means. but be prepared 
for what may happen as a Q31
result. 
They can actually 
cause damage, which is not at all the intention. 

Business 
leaders 
generally 
try to do the right thing. 
But all too often the right thing backfires, 
if those leaders 
adopt values without 
understanding and 
managing 
the side effects 
that arise. 
The values can easily 
get in the way of what's actually 
intended. 

Q32 

OK. So the first 
value I'm going to discuss 
is collaboration. 
Er, let me give you an example. 
On a management 
training 
course I once attended, 
we were put into groups and had to Q33 
construct 
a bridge across a stream, 
using building 
blocks that we were given. 
The rule was 
that everyone 
in the team had to move at least one building 
block during the construction. 
This was intended 
to encourage 
teamwork. 

98 

Test5 

But it was really 
a job best done by one person. 
The other teams tried to collaborate 
building 
the structure, 
and descended 
into confusion, 
with everyone 
getting 
in each other's 
way. Our team leader 
solved the challenge 
brilliantly. 
She simply asked everyone 
in the team 
to move a piece a few centimetres, 
to comply with the rule, and 
then let the person in the 
team with an aptitude 
for puzzles 
like this build it alone. 
We finished 
before any other team. 
My point is that the task wasn't 
really 
suited 
to teamworking, 
so why make it one? 

on Q34 

Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency 
- a common cause of poor sales. 
In the case of Q35 
a smartphone 
that a certain 
company launched, 
one director 
wanted to target 
the business 
market. and another demanded 
it was aimed at consumers. 
The company wanted both 
directors 
to be involved, 
so gave the product 
a consumer-friendly 
name. but marketed 
it to 
companies. 
The result was 
that it met the needs of neither 
group. It would have been better 
to let one director 
or the other have his way, not both. 

Now industriousness, 
or hard work. It's easy to mock people who say they 
work hard: after 
all, a hamster 
running around 
in a wheel is working 
hard -and getting nowhere. 
Of course 
hard work is valuable, 
but only when properly 
targeted. 
Otherwise 
it wastes the resources Q36 
that companies 
value most -time and energy. 
And that's 
bad for the organisation. 
There's 
a management 
model that groups people according 
to four criteria: 
clever, hard-
working, 
stupid 
and lazy. Here 'lazy' 
means having a rational 
determination 
not to carry out Q37 
unnecessary 
tasks. 
It doesn't 
mean trying to 
avoid work altogether. 
Most people display 
two 
of these characteristics, 
and the most 
valuable 
people are those who 
are both clever 
and 
lazy: they possess 
intellectual 
clarity, 
anq they don't rush into 
making decisions. 
They come 
up with solutions 
to save the time and 
energy spentby 
the stupid 
and hard-working 
group. 
Instead 
of throwing 
more man-hours 
at a problem, 
the clever and lazy group looks for a more 
effective 
solution. 
Next we come to creativity. 
This often 
works well -creating 
an attention-grabbing 
TV 
commercial, 
for example, 
might lead to increased 
sales. 
But it isn't 
always a good thing. 
Some advertising 
campaigns 
are remembered 
for their creativity, 
without having 
any effect 
on sales. 
This happened 
a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate 
bar: subsequent Q38 
research 
showed that plenty 
of consumers remembered 
the adverts. 
but had no idea what 
was being advertised. 
The trouble 
is that the creator 
derives 
pleasure 
from coming up with 
the idea, and wrongly 
assumes the audience 
for the campaign 
will share that feeling. 

A company that brings 
out thousands 
of new products 
may seem more creative 
than a 
company that only has a few, but it may be 
creative, 
and make smaller 
profits. 
Creativity 
needs to be targeted. 
to solve a problem 
that the company has identified. 
Just coming up with 
more and more novel products 
isn't necessarily 
a good thing. 

Q39

that claim they 'striveJor

but __ 
it takes a long time to achieve

In business, 
being first with a product

profitable 
than having the best

The study found that the Q40
pioneers 
commanded 
an average 
market share of 29 percent. 
while the followers 
achieved 
less than half that. only 13 percent 
-even though 
their product 
might have been better. 

Insisting 
on excellence 
in everything 
we do is time-consuming, 
wastes energy and leads 
to losing 
out on opportunities. 
Sometimes, 
second-rate 
work is more worthwhile 
than 
excellence. 
'Make sure it's excellent' 
sounds like a good approach 
to business, 
but the 'just­
get-started' 
approach 
is likely 
to be more successful.

I certainly have. She was a scientist years ago. 
That's right. She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago, so we're celebrating 
her centenary. 
I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her. I didn't realise she came from 
Kenton. 
Yes. Well, all that will take place in the afternoon, and later. as the sun sets. there'll Q5 
be a firework display. You should go to the park to watch. as you'll get the best view

It's in the market in the town centre - the outdoor one. not the covered market. And Q9
it's on a t 2 and 5 every afternoon of the festival, apart from the first day. 
Lovely. I'm interested in all kinds of dancing, so I'm sure I'll enjoy that! 
Mmm. I'm sure you will. 
WOMAN: And I'd really like to go to some concerts, if there are any. 
Yes, there are several. Three performed by professionals, and one by local children.

It's in the library, which is in Park Street. On the 18 th , at 6.30 in the evening. 
I presume I'll need tickets for that. 
Yes. you can book online. or you can buy them when you arrive in Kenton. either at Q10
the festival box office. or from any shops displaying our logo in the windows.

SECTION 2 

Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I'll bring you up to date 
with what I know. 
As you know, we're flying firstto. Munich, on Monday the 4th .
The flight is a t 11.30, so it's too early to have lunch at the airport. I suggest we meet there for 011
coffee at 10, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home. 
When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour Q12
operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany. He's already liaised with 
the managers of the theatres we're going to visit, and he's also arranged for an officer of the 
National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay. 
Now last time we discussed this trip, I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now 
I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double 
room. I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros. but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate 
o f 110. That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this 
week. 

013 

On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of 
the theatres, but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange, so instead we'll have a 
· coach trip to one of the amazing·castles in the mountains south of Munich.

-

On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From
talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be
too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must
confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to
an Italian restaurant at home.

014 

On Wednesday afternoon. the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to Q15 
us a t the theatre. She'll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she
chose the actors, and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one. how she worked with
the playwright.

101 

Audioscripts 

Right. Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see, partly 
because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you! 

The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we're going to the 
premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don't have to dress 
formally. I gather it's rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a 
soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be 
able to attend. 

On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was 
commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist. 
We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest. 

Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it'll be in the 
garden of a palace. It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much 
protection from the wind. 

Q16 

Q17 

Q 18

On Saturday. we're going by coach to a theatre in another town. not far from Munich. This will Q19
be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will 
be attending. After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and 
there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region. 

And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday. and it's in the stunning 
setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14 th century: The performance marks the 
fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his 
first professional appearance, all those years ago. 

Q20 

And the day after that, we'll be flying back home. Now have you got any questions before I ... 

SECTION 3 

Oh good morning. You must be James. I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth. 
Thank you. 
Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies 
course, I'd like to find out something about you. Why did you decide to take this 
course? 
Wel l. my mother is Danish. and although we always lived in England, she used to 
talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit Denmark. We hardly ever 
did. though - my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or 
friends were in England they always came to see us. 
I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be 
studying. 
I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate. 
Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad. Have 
you had any thoughts about that? 
I'm really looking forward to it. And although Denmark seems the obvious place to 
go, because of my family connections, I'd love to spend the time in Iceland. 
Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged. Do you have any plans for when you graduate? A lot 
o f students go on to take a master's degree. 
I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I'm 
interested in journalism. and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing 
for magazines. I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most 
graduates do.

That'll continue next term, but the one on Scandinavian literature that's running at the 023 
moment will be replaced by more specialised courses. Oh, and by the way, if you're 
interested in watching Danish television programmes - there's going to be a course 
on that the term after next. 
JAMES: That sounds good. 
Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next 
few weeks? 
JAMES: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas. 
Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be 
difficult to get hold of the books you'll need. Why not leave that for another time? 
JAMES: Right. 
You might find modern novels or 19 th century playwrights interesting. 
I've read o r seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea. 
Fine. I'll put you down for that topic. 
JAMES: Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper? 
First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail. That 
approach certainly has its place, but I think you first need to get an understanding 
of the literature in the context of the society in which i t was produced - who it was 
written for, how it was published, and so on. I also think that's more fruitful than 
placing it within the history of the genre. 
JAMES: OK, that sounds reasonable.

Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the 
Vikings? I have to do that this week, and I'm a bit stuck. 
Of course. Have you decided yet what to write about? 
No, I haven't. There's so much that seems interesting - Viking settlement in other 
countries, trade, mythology ... 
Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which 
is kept in the library. It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find i t helpful. I'll 
give you the details in a moment. Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be 
very difficult to choose just one. 
OK. I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year. 
Should I watch that again? 
If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it - it's more fantasy than reality. 
But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch. It makes some 
interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic. 
Right·· --
So then should I work out an outline? 
Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage. And then you should start 
looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise 
according to those headings. 
I see. 
Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading. Make 
sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper 
in full. 
OK. Thanks, that's very helpful.

SECTION 4 

Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably. After all, there was a 
time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions. Conditions have 
improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common. And human resources managers 
nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary. 

What is conflict in the workplace? Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range 
of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to - at the 
opposite extreme - physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying, by which 
I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a 
weaker position. Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be 
described in these terms. 

Q31 

As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it. But often it's caused by 
someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else, in order to feel that 
they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people. 

Q32 

In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the personality o f one Q33 
is in some way incompatible with that of the other person. A general habit of optimism in one 
person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic - not that that 
justifies treating them badly, of course. 

Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their 
team than in the company as a whole. These conflicts are called 'structural', and could come 
about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who 
do any useful work, and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators. 

Q34 

Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned - the situation is likely to be very stressful Q35 
for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months. For the company, if no 
effort is made to deal with conflict, it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown 
of the business. 

Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs - has uncovered some of the reasons 
why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics: 
confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable o f great achievements - with a high level 
o f anxiety, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves o r by the directors of the 
company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their 
decisions. 

In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic. And it's 
particularly difficult to tackle the situation where colleagues, managers and board members 
are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can't agree on strategic issues and on 
where they see the business going. there are real problems. 

Q36 

Q37 

For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an autocratic form 
of management - where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -
would see more conflict than others. Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic Q38 
business model. can suffer 
when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting 
demands. 

more. 

Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects. Of course 
the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place. A good manager, at any level. will make 
efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with, particularly those who report to them. 
That will involve politeness in all communications, and treating them as equals who happen 
to have a different role within the organisation. 

Q39 

104 

Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand. In such cases the human 
resources department often gets involved. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees 
human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive, then an external mediator 
might be able to help. By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been 
happening, they can build a clear picture of the situation, and give feedback that both sides 
will accept, precisely because they're independent.

Hi, Susie, it's Paul here. How are you? Enjoying your new job? You're working at

Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while. 
sus1E: Oh, you should. It doesn't cost anything, and the new library has all sorts of 
facilities. It's not Just a place where you borrow books. For instance, there's an 
area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have 
there. Some people spend the whole morning there. 
Mmm. Wish I had that amount of time to spend!

useful? 
Yes, actually we've now got a new section with materials on the history of the town 02

And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge . That doesn 't

So that gives them something to do while they 're on holiday , instead of getting

Q10 

SECTION 2 

In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays 
we offer at BC Travel. Now, the travel business is very competitive and it's important to be 
aware of how the market's changing and developing. In terms of age groups, the over -65s are 
an important market, and one that's increasing steadily year on year. The fewest holidays are 
taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds , and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at 
present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group's also seen the biggest drop 
over the last few years, whereas there 's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken 
by the 55 to 64-year-olds. As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned , bookings there are 
steady, but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected. 

Q11 & 
Q12 

Q11 & 
Q12 

One trend we 're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays 
in which clients do some kind of spec ialised activity. I'm not talking here about adventure 
holidays , where clients take part in high - risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill 
of it. Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music. 
They 're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite , in fact. But they 
do often take place outside the main tourist centres. which gives an opportunity for clients 
to find out more about the local people and customs, and many say this is one of the most 
positive features of these holidays . Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or 

Q13 & 
Q14 

106 

Test 7 

talent, but clients often say that more than this. it's the chance to create lasting relationships 
with other like-minded people that's the main draw. 

013 & 
014 

Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays. Our painting holidays take 
place in four different centres in France and Italy and they're very popular with clients of all 
abilities from beginners onwards. We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -
some of them have been with us from the start. and five addit ional ones will be joining us this 
year so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre. 

As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients 
cook recipes related to one particular country, usually the one they 're staying in. but we focus 
on dishes from a great many different ones. Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis 
on good quality, organic ingredients - that's more or less a given nowadays - and there are 
generally some meat-free recipes included. 

Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, 
and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery . Groups are small, no more 
than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday. and excursions are 
arranged with fully-trained guides . At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the 
photographs taken so that clients can see one another 's work and receive valuable feedback 
from the tutor. 

015 

016 

017 

Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays. In rrel'and and Italy we run ohe-week 
general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness .. Clients start the course with a 
consultation with a trainer, and together the y draw up an individual programme . As well as 
improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built O 18 
up in their daily lives. 

In Greece. we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their 
we ight. This has all the features you 'd expect, like a personalised diet programme, but one 
of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. People say 
it's far preferable to being in a gym. 

Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the mountain biking 
holiday. Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability. We 
offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular . 

OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so thank you very much ... 

_ NATALIE : Dave, I'm worried about our case study, rve done a bit of reading, but I'm not sure 
what's involved in actually writing a case study - I missed the lecture where Dr 
Baker talked us through it. 
OK, well it's quite straightforward . We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton 
Castle site. And you said you'd done some reading about it. 
NATALIE: Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points. 
Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? 
NATALIE: Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that. 
OK , so we can compare what we've read . Then we have to decide on a particular 
problem or need at our site . And then think about who we 're going to interview to get 
more information.

DAV E : 

NATALIE: OK. So who'd that be? The people who work there? And presumably some of the 
tourists too? 
Yes, both those groups. So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose . But we 
might also do some of our interviewing away from the site - we cou ld even contact 
some people here in the city. l ike administrators involved in overseein g tour ism . 
NATALIE: OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and fix times and places for 
the meetings. It's all going to take a lot of time. 
Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some 
numerical data that we can add to support our findings. 
NATALIE : And photographs? 
I think we have plenty of those already. But Dr Baker also sa id we have to establish 
with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study. or whether 
they want to be anonymous . 
NATALIE : Oh, I wouldn 't have thought of that. OK , once we 've got al l this information, 
I suppose we have to analyse it. 
Yes, put it a ll together and choose what's relevant to th e problem we 're focusing 
on, and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identi fy any tre nds or regularities 
there . That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots 
of facts. 
NATA LIE : OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next? 
DAVE: Well , then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected to make 
it as clear as possible to our readers. Things like grc;1phs, or tables, or charts ... 

DAVE: 

DAVE: 

NATALIE: Right. 
DAVE: 

Then the case study itse lf is mostly quite standard ; we begin by presenting the 
problem, and giving some background, then go through t he main sections , but th e 
thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we 'd end with some suggestions 
to deal with the problem or need we identified. but in a case study we end up with a 
question or a series of questions to our readers. and th ey decide wh at o ught to be 
done. 
NATALIE: Oh , I had n 't realised that. 

DAVE: 

NATALIE : So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Ho rton Castle 
site is why so few tourists are vi sit ing it. And we 'll find out more from our interv iews, 
but I d id find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be 
because as far as transpo rt goes, access is d ifficu lt. 
I read that too , but th at report wa s ac tually writt e n ten yea rs ago, wh en th e road 
there was rea lly bad, but that's been improved now. And I th ink there's plenty of 
fascinating stuff there for a rea lly good day out. but you 'd never rea lise it from the 
castl e website - maybe that's the problem . 
NATALIE : Yes, it's rea lly dry and boring. 
I read somewh e re a suggest ion that wh at the castle needs is a visitor ce ntre. So w e 
could have a look for some inform ation abo ut that on the internet. What would we 
need to know? 
NATALI E: Well , who 'd use it for a start . It'd be good to know wh at categor ies the visitors fell 
into too, like school pa rties o r retired people, but I think we'd have to ta lk to staff to 
get that inform ation . 
OK . And as we're thinking of suggesting a v is itor ce ntre w e'd also have to look at 
potential problems . I mean, obvious ly it wouldn't be cheap to set up. 
NATALI E: No , but it cou ld be a really good investment. And as it's on a histor ica l site it'd need 
to get spec ia l planning permission. I expect. Th at might be hard .

Right , especially as the only possible place for it would be at t he entrance , and th at's 
right in front of the castle. 

NATALIE : Mmm . 
DAVE: 

But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton. At present it's a bit of a ghos t 
town. Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifi cations, the young people 
all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the only people left are 
children and those who 've retired. 
NATALIE : Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that 
tourists m ight cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact. At present 
the tourists can just wander round wherever they want, but if numbers increase , 
there might have to be some restrictions, l ike stic k ing to marked ways. And the re 'd

OK , so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife . 
Now I'll discuss a particular examp le. Let's take a look at me rcury. Mercury 's one of the 120 or 
so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbo l Hg. It's a shiny , s ilvery subs tance . 
You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it's not used much for domestic 
purposes now because it's highly tox ic . 

But the problem is that the arnount of merc u ry in the environme nt's increas ing. Th e main 
reaso n fo r t his is the power plants used to prod uce e lect ricity . T he ma in so urce of energy tha t 
m ost of t hem use is st ill coal, and w hen it's burned it releases mercu ry into t he atm os phere. 
Some of this gets deposi ted into lakes and rivers, and if it's ingested by a fish it's not 
ex c rete d , it sta ys in the fis h's body a nd it enters t he food ch ai n . So it's bee n known for some 
time th at b irds w hic h eat fish may be affected, but w hat wa s n't know n until quite recent ly is 
that those that eat insects can also be affected . 

So a woman called C laire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting 
birds . 

And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by merc ury poison ing , she 's 
looking for more subtle sub-effects . And these may be to do w ith the behaviou r of the birds, 
or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems 
with memory, for examp le . And she 's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on 
bird song. Now . the process of song learning happens at a part icular stage in the birds' 
development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by 
·listening to the songs produced by ' its ·father,-rather than by ,any othe r bird. ··· · 

031 

032 

033 

And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male b irds are expose d to 034 
. mercury, if they"eat food contam inate·d with inercuiy, ·then . the so ngs fh-ey-produce -a ren'fEis· -· 
complex as those prod uced by other birds . So quite low-leve l exposure to mercury is l ike ly 
to have an impact on male birds in a nat ural situation , because it can mean that they 're less 
attract ive to female birds , and so it can affect their chances of reproduct ion . 

03 5 

Now the way she's carryi ng out this research is worth thinking about. She 's using a mixt ure 
of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carr ied out outdoo rs in the wild. T he 
lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a 
natural setting, so the experimenter has a much higher level of control, and that means they 
can be more confident about their results in some ways . And of course they don 't have to 
worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them . 

036 

109 

Audioscripts 

So what are the implications here for humans? Well , because many birds are migratory, they Q37 
may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites . For example, it's been found that 
ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters ove r a thousand 
kilometres away, and presumably eaten. But these birds likely had mercury levels high 
enough to warrant concern for human consumption. 

In addit ion, going back to song learning by birds , we saw that this may be affected by 
mercury contamination. Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental 
delays in the acquisition of language, and in fact this process is very similar in the brain 
regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But mercury contamination has 
other important implications for humans as well. It's now known that an unborn child can be 
affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury, and these effects can 
be quite substantial. 

In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing 
or environmental wellbeing. It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from 
power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for 
everyone . Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wild life. But as we 've seen , the 
issues go beyond that , and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully .

Hello , Pembroke Cycling Holidays, Bob speaking. 
Oh hello. I've seen your advert for people to lead cycle trip s. Are you the right 
person to speak to? 
Yes , I am. Could I have your name , please? 
It's Margaret Smith. 
Are you looking for a permanent job, Margaret? 
No, temporary. I've got a permanent job starting in a few months ' time, and I 
want to do something else until then. 
What work do you do? 
This will probably sound crazy - I used to be a lawyer, and then I made a 
complete career change and I'm going to be a doctor . I've just finished my 
tra ining. 
Right. And have you had any experience of leading cycle tr ips? 
Yes, I've led several bike tours in Africa. The trip to India that I had arranged to 
lead next month has now been cancelled, so when I saw you were advert ising 
for tour leaders , I decided to apply . 
OK. Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size 
of the group. Some tours are for very experienced cyclists , but we've got a tour 
coming up soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional 
leader . It's a cycling holiday for families . Would that suit you? 
It certainly would. I enjoy working with children, and I probably need some more 
experience before I go on a really challenging trip. 
That tour includes several teenagers : have you worked with that age group 
before? 
Yes, I'm a volunteer worker in a youth club, where I help people to improve their 
cycling skills . Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.

W~Jc_ome ta. this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city, 
As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep , 
but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing , vibrant area of the city, which is also home to 
one of the city 's fastest-growing communities. The nearby university has always meant the 
area's popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates 
embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments 
recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live . 

The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures. jewellery and 
ceramics which won't break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables . 
There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all

over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the 
city 's first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today . 

The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there's a policy of encouraging new young 
designers. The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate 
about fashion. This year they 've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from th e 
music and technology that's part of their everyday l ife, using both natural and man-made 
fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers, and the 
winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening. 

Q13 

Parking at the Sheepmarket 
is easy. There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces 
on the roadsides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want 
to spend the day there it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It's not 
expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores. you 'll not be charged Q14 
at all. After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very 
reasonable. 

The Sheepmarket 
is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country. 
If you look at our map, you ' ll see some of the main attractions there . Most visitors start from 
Crawley Road , at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in Q15 
the city. and is open to the public. It's on the north side of Crawley Road. next to the footpath 
that leads to the public gardens. 

The area 's particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures . The Thumb' is1ust what ~ts name Q16 
suggests. but it's about 10 metres high . You'll see it on Hill Road. across the road froni the 
Bank . 

The Museum 's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes. It's on the east 
side of the Sheepmarket. on City Road. It's on the other side of the road from the pub lic 
gardens. immediately facing the junction with Hill Road. 

Q17 

The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off St ation Square. not far fr om the Q18 
public gardens. The road ends at th e gallery - it doesn't go anywhere else. That's open eve ry 
day except Mondays . 

The W a rner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art. It's on City Ro ad . near the junction with 
Crawley Road. on th e same side of the road as th e public gardens. It's op e n on w ee kdays 
from 9 to 5 , and entry is free . 

Q19 

Finally. if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork. the place to go is Nucleus . You Q2O 
ne ed to go from Cr awley Road up through Sta tion Square and east along Hill Road until you 
get to a small winding road turning off . Go up there and it's on your right - if you get to City 
Road you've gone too far.

It's about film adap t ations of S hak espea re 's plays. I've got v e ry int erested in a ll th e

JOE: 

KATIE: So I thought I'd start with Giannetti, who's a professor of film and literature, and in one 021 
of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations based 
on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels . 
Right. 
I've already made some notes on that, so I just need to sort those out before the 
presentation. I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the worst examples 
of Shakespeare adaptations that they've seen, and to say why. That should be more 
fun than having their favourite versions. 
Yes, I ca n certainly think of a couple! 
KATIE: Right. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow . I came across something on the 
internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film 
clips to illustrate her ideas. 
JOE: Will you have enough time , though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? 
After all , I doubt if you'll be able to find all the cl ips you want. 
KATIE: Hmm. Perhaps you're right. OK, well, I'd better do some slides instead, saying how 
various films relate to what she says. That should encourage discussion. 
JOE : Mmm . 
KATIE : Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because 024 
they're concerned with issues of the time when the film is made. 
You mean things like patriotism, or the role of governments? 
KATIE: Exactly. It's quite tricky, but I've got a few ideas I'd like to discuss.

KATIE : And finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of 
approac hes , and make some comments on them . Do you know the Japanes e filni 
Ran? 
I haven' t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare 's King Lear , wasn 't it? 
KATIE: That's right. It was a very loose adaptat ion. using the same situation and sto ry, but 
moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain. So for example t he 
king 's daughters become sons, because in Japanese cu lture at that time, women 
couldn't succeed to the throne. 
JOE: OK. I hope you're going to talk about the1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think 
that's one of the best Shakespeare films . It really brings the play to life , doesn't it? 
KATIE: Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what 
life was like at the time of the play. 
JOE : Absolutely . Right, what's next? 
KATIE: Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet , the 1996 film, which moves the action into the 
present day. 
JOE : Yes, it worked really well , I thought - changing the two feuding families in the original 
to two competing business empires, even though they're speaking in the English of the 
original play. 
KATIE : YoLJ'd ~xp~ct it would sound really b_izarre, but I found I soon got used to it. . 
JOE: Me too. 
KATIE : Then I thought I'd include a real Hollywood film , one that's intended to appeal to a 
mass commercial audience. 
There must be quite a number of those. 
KATIE: Yes, but I've picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but 
it's more like a typical action hero movie - there are loads of special effects, but no 
unifying interpretation of the play. 
JO E : All show and no substance. 
KATIE: Exactly. Then there's Prospero 's Books, based on The Tempest. That was really 
innovative, from a stylistic point of view .

KATIE: Yes. it did. I also want to mention Looking for Richard . Did you ever see it? 
No. but I've read about it. It was a blend of a documen tary with a few scenes from 
Richard Ill, wasn 't it? 
KATIE : That's right. It's more a way of looking into how people nowadays conne ct wi th the 
playwright - the play is really just th e starting point. And tha t' l l be where I finish . 
JOE : Well , it sounds as though it'll be very interesting .

SECTION 4 

This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, t he study of sound , in relation to urban 
environments such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself , I think this is an area where 
we're likely to see great changes . In the past , researching urban sounds capes was simple . 
We measured levels of sound in decibels , so I used to take my sound meter and I measured 
the noise somewhere , and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sou nd 
became annoying . 

With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up wha t we call no ise maps , 
maps of the sound environment. But actually these aren't a lot of use . What the y do show is 
that the highest noise levels are generally on roads - well, that's not really ver y surpr ising . 
But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don 't show , because they can 't captur e 
the complex way that sound varies over time . So they ignore important issues such as the 
noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours , and th is 
sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don't have any databases on this sort 
of information . As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact 
that people vary in their perceptions of no ise - so someone like me with years of wor k ing in 
acoust ics might be very different from you in that regard . 

0 3 1 

But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude, they 've been usefu l in providi ng 
information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it's a 
political matter. And that's important - we need rules and regulations because noise can 
cause all sorts of problems. 

0 32 

Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so c ity-dwe llers 
often suffer from interrupted sleep . It's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of 
stress , due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood. A nd there 
are other problems as well, for instance if schoolchildren don 't have a qu iet place to study . 
their work will suffer. 

Now , one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn 't differentiate between different 
types of noise. Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and 
relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels - think of the sound made by a fountain 
in a town square, for example . That's not necessarily something that we 'd want to contro l o r 
reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design . This is 
going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn 't going to help us here . Instead, 
many researchers are using social science techniques, studying people 's emotional response 
to sound by using questionnaires and so on. 

03 3 

0 34 

035 

So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent 
interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradi ctory - Q._ 036 
city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of 
high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee mach ine, but these mustn 't be too intrusive. 
because at the same time we need to be able to relax. 

114 

One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to 
use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very 
little training in this area. But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add 
to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they tend to see it as something to be 
avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that's just a job for engineers like the 
street drainage system. 

TestB 

037 

What's needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something 
that has the qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to 
know what governs it and how designers can work with it. We need to develop a complex 
understanding of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? What 
can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with 
human development and social relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and 
feelings? Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself? 

Today's powerful technologies can also help us . To show us their ideas and help us to 
imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual 
reality- but these programs are silent. In the future such programs could use realistic 
sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using 
the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the 
ears as well as the eyes.

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate covers the key features and rounds off the description with an 
overview. Organisation is evident, however not wholly logical, and it is sometimes 
difficult to relate data to specific age groups. Vocabulary is just about adequate, 
but is rather dependent on input material [regular physical activity I percentage]: 
original material is limited to e.g. [teenager I mid-twenties] with a lot of inaccuracy 
in word formation. Most sentence forms consist of simple structures and these 
are often inaccurate [bars's changed and interesting I men's percentage are 
increasing I the percentage more decrease unti�, though there is some accuracy in 
comparative forms [is higher than].

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate addresses all parts of the prompt, although there is some 
misunderstanding of the term shared freely. Ideas relating to each sector 
mentioned in the prompt are presented, yet there is not much development of 
these, especially of sharing ideas in the business world. There is a clear overall 
progression, with the candidate's own opinion presented at the end, but there 
are some errors in the use of cohesive devices [working there on out of this I 
which scientist]. Lexis is mainly appropriate for the task, though there are some 
errors in word choice [actual I releases] and spelling [govenment I limite I 
theme I loose]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, with a fair 
degree of accuracy: errors in grammatical control seldom prevent meaning from 
coming through.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The response looks at some advantages and disadvantages of the topic, but 
does not reach any conclusion. As a result, there is a lack of overall progression, 
although organisation is evident and cohesive devices are used (though rather 
mechanically) [One of advantages I For example I A/so I Another disadvantage I 
For instance]. The range of lexis is adequate for the task, however there are often 
spelling mistakes [contries I yonge I quilifiedj and errors in word choice or formation 
[chancing to improve I unemployee problem]. There are attempts to produce 
complex sentence forms, but there is a lack of grammatical control which can 
cause some difficulty for the reader [ ... due to some countries limit the population, if 
that have more young children it will over limit].

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate organises the information well and describes the trends in the 
various groups, but the lack of data to support the descriptions is a significant 
omission. There is a clear progression throughout the response, with good 
management of cohesive devices [percentage of people who I during the same 
period I in these segments o f the chart I the groups in which I such facilities]. Lexis 
shows some flexibility and precision [on a weekly basis] and there is evidence of 
less common items [segments I major changes I most of the population I most/ 
least popular I with the exception 
with few errors in word choice [visualises I be 
I clients]. There is a variety of complex structures used with flexibility and accuracy, 
but there are also a few errors in grammatical control and in punctuation.

TEST 7, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 7.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is a good response which would achieve an even higher score if there was 
more focus on large sums of money and on between cities. The writing is well 
organised and there is a clear progression throughout, although the use of some 
cohesive devices could be more flexible. There is a wide range of vocabulary, 
used appropriately and naturally, [preferred method of transporlation I leave the 
driving to the professional I more affordable I ever-expanding urban populations I 
embrace the idea of], but some spelling errors are noted [Communters I whi// I cheif 
I ammount I busses]. There is a wide range of structures and again, these are used 
flexibly, however there are occasional errors in punctuation.

TEST 8, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate has provided a clear introduction and an overview of the key 
stages of the process. Each stage is identified and described, although there are 
some minor errors in the reporting of stage 5. There is room for expansion of the 
description of each stage, which could help to achieve a higher score. There is a 
clear overall progression, with each stage being signalled by appropriate markers 
[First I in order to I After that I At this point I Then, the final step I Finally]. These 
markers are adequate, but a higher score might be achieved by varying their 
position in each sentence, rather than always placing them at the beginning. The 
range of vocabulary is adequate for the task and there are attempts to use more 
variety here [five general steps I connected I accumulated], though there are 
some examples of error in word choice .[box I tank I a circle movements I a circular 
movement], in spelling [undergrownd I trough I conteiner I sumary] and in word 
formation [condensered I condensed I gas I gaseous I :trasladated I transferred? I 
condensering I condensing]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, 
including accurate use of passive forms. There are some errors [a/ an I who I 
what], but otherwise the level of accuracy is good. The same level of accuracy, over 
a wider range of sentence forms, would increase the score on Grammatical Range 
and Accuracy.

TEST 8, WRITING TASK 2 

' 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is an attempt to address the prompt and some main ideas are put forward, 
but there is no discussion of is likely to result in a society of individuals who 
only think about their own wishes. This omission, and the fact that the response 
is underlength, limit the Band score rating. Organisation is evident, however the 
answer lacks contextualisation, and cohesion within sentences is sometimes 
faulty [that is cause many African children to ... I they will show respect to their 
ad community in is genera�. Vocabulary is the strongest aspect of the response 
[confident I make mistakes I dictate I the right path I do something wrong I manage 
their affairs I vandals and aggressors I determine their own choices I show respect 
I oppressed I respect children I justify] and although spelling errors occur, they do 
not generally prevent meaning from coming through [becouse I fought I smagging]. 
Grammatical control is variabl.e: some complex structures are produced accurately 
while other, simpler, forms contain errors. Punctuation and capitalisation are also 
sometimes faulty.

Introduction

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is widely recognised as 
a reliable means of assessing the language ability of candidates who need to study 
or work where English is the language of communication. These Practice Tests are 
designed to give future IELTS candidates an idea of whether their English is at the 
required level.
IELTS is owned by three partners, Cambridge English Language Assessment, part of 
the University of Cambridge, the British Council and IDP Education Pty Limited (through 
its subsidiary company, IELTS Australia Pty Limited). Further information on IELTS can 
be found on the IELTS website www.ielts.org.

WHAT IS THE TEST FORMAT?

IELTS consists of four components. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking 
tests. There is a choice of Reading and Writing tests according to whether a candidate is 
taking the Academic or General Training module.

Academic
For candidates wishing to study at 
undergraduate or postgraduate levels, 
and for those seeking professional 
registration.

General Training
For candidates wishing to migrate to an 
English-speaking country (Australia, Canada, 
New Zealand, UK), and for those wishing to 
train or study at below degree level.

The test components are taken in the following order:

Listening
4 sections, 40 items, approximately 30 minutes

Academic Reading 
3 sections, 40 items
60 minutes

Academic Writing

Introduction 

HOW IS IELTS SCORED? 

IELTS results are reported on a nine-band scale. In addition to the score for ove rall language 
ability, IELTS provides a score in the form of a profile for each of the four skills (Listening, 
Reading , Writing and Speaking). These scores are also reported on a nine-band scale. Al l 
scores are recorded on the Test Report Form along with details of the candidate's nationality , 
first language and date of birth. Each Overall Band Score corresponds to a descriptive 
statement which gives a summary of the English language ability of a candidate classified at 
that level. The nine bands and their descriptive statements are as follows : 

9 Expert User - Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate , accurate and 
fluent with complete understanding. 

8 Very Good User - Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional 
unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in 
unfamiliar situations . Handles complex detailed argumentation well. 

7 Good User - Has operational command of the language, though with occasional 
inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally 
handles complex language weJI and understands detailed reasoning . 

6 Competen t User - Has generally effective command of the language despit e some 
inaccu racies, inapprop riacies and misunder s tandings. Can use and unde rs tand fairly 
compl ex language , part ic ula rly in famili ar si tuat ions. 

5 Modest User - Has partial command of the language , coping with overall meaning in 
most situations , though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic 
communicat ion in own field. 

4 Limited User - Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems 
in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language.

Introduction 

MARKING THE PRACTICE TESTS 

Listening and Reading 

The Answer Keys are on pages 116-123 . 
Each question in the Listening and Reading tests is worth one mark . 

Questions which require letter I Roman numeral answers 

• For questions where the answers are letters or Roman numerals, you should write only 
the number of answers required. For example, if the answer is a single letter or numeral 
you should write only one answer. If you have written more letters or numerals than are 
required, the answer must be marked wrong. 

Questions which require answers in the form of words or numbers 

• Answers may be written in upper or lower case . 
• Words in brackets are optional - they are correct, but not necessary . 
• Alternative answers are separated by a slash (/). 
• 
If you are asked to write an answer using a certain number of words and/or (a) 
number(s), you will be penalised if you exceed this. For example, if a question specifies 
an answer using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS and the correct answer is 'black 
leather coat', the answer 'coat of black leather ' is incorrect. 
In questions where you are expected to complete a gap, you should only transfer the 
necessary missing word(s) onto the answer sheet. For example, to complete 'in the ... ', 
where the correct answer is 'morning', the answer 'in the morning' would be incorrect. 
• All answers require correct spelling (including words in brackets) . 
• Both US and UK spelling are acceptable and are included in the Answer Key. 
• All standard alternatives for numbers, dates and currencies are acceptable. 
• All standard abbreviations are acceptable. 
• You will find additional notes about individual answers in the Answer Key . 

• 

Writing 

The sample answers are on pages 124-131. It is not possible for you to give yourself a mark 
for the Writing tasks. We have provided sample answers (written by candidates), showing 
their score and the examiner's comments. These sample answers will give you an insight 
into what is required for the Writing test.

Introduction 

HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES? 

At the end of each Listening and Reading Answer Key you will find a chart which will help 
you assess whether, on the basis of your Practice Test results, you are ready to take the 
IELTS test. 
In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind. Your 
performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band Score 
from 1 to 9 for each of the components and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which 
is the average of your scores in the four components . However, institutions considering 
your application are advised to look at both the Overall Band Score and the Bands for 
each component in order to determine whether you have the language skills needed for a 
particular course of study. For example, if your course involves a lot of reading and writing, 
but no lectures, listening skills might be less important and a score of 5 in Listening might be 
acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a course which has lots of lectures 
and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening might be unacceptable even though the 
Overall Band Score was 7 . 
Once you have marked your tests, you should have some idea of whether your listening 
and reading skills are good enough for you to try the IELTS test. If you did well enough in 
. one component, but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are ready 
to take the test. 
The Practice Tests have been checked to ensure that they are of approximately the same 
level of difficulty as the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the 
Practice Tests will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you 
an idea of your poss ible future performance and it is u ltimately up to you to make decisions 
based on your score. 
Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have 
based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept. 
The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score than 
most other institutions.

READING PASSAGE 

1 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13 , which are based on Reading 
Passage 1 below. 

Cork 

Cork - the thick bark of the cork oak 
tree (Quercus suber) - is a remarkable 
material. It is tough, elastic, buoyant , 
and fire-resistant, and su itab le for a 
wide range of purposes. It has a lso 
been us ed for millen ni a: th e anci ent 
Egyptians sealed their sa rcopha gi 
(stone coffins) with cork, while the 
ancient Greeks and Romans used it 
for anything from beehives to sandals. 

And the cork oak itself is an 
extraordinary tree. Its bark grows 
up to 20 cm in thickness, insulating 
the tree like a coat wrapped around 
the tr unk and br anches and keeping 
th e inside at a constant 20°C all year 
round. Developed most probably as 
a defence against forest fires, th e 
bark of the cork oak has a particular 
cellular structure - with about 
40 million cells per cubic centimetre -
that technology has nev er succeeded 
in re plicatin g . Th e cells are filled with 
air, which is why cork is so buoyant. 
It also has an elasticity that means 
you can squash it and watch it spring 
back to its original size and shape 
when you release the pressure. 

Cork oaks grow in a number of 
Mediterranean countries, including 

Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and 
Morocco. They flourish in warm, sunny 
climates wher e there is a minimum of 
400 millimetres of rain per year, and 
not more than 800 millimetres. Like 
grape vines, th e tre es thrive in poor 
soil, putting down deep roots in search 
of moisture and nutrients. Southern 
Portugal's Alen tejo region m eet s all of 
these requirements, wh ich explains 
why, by the early 20th century, this 
region had become the wor ld 's largest 
producer of cork, and why today it 
accounts for roughly half of all cork 
production around the world. 

Most cork forests are famil y-owned. 
Many of these family businesses , and 
ind eed many of the trees the1nsel ve s, 
are around 200 years old. Cork 
production is , above all, an exercise in 
patience. From the planting of a cork 
sapling to the first harvest takes 25 
years, and a gap of approximately a 
decade must separate harvests from 
an individual tree . And for top-quality 
cork, it's necessary to wait a further 
15 or 20 years . You even have to wait 
for the right kind of summer's da y to 
harvest cork. If the bark is stripped on 
a da y when it's too cold - or when the 
air is damp - the tree will be damaged . 

16 

Reading 

Cork harvesting is a very specialised 
profession. No mechanical means 
of stripping cork bark has been 
invented, so the job is done by teams 
of highly skilled workers . First, they 
make vertical cuts down the bark 
using small sharp axes, then lever · 
it away in pieces as large as they 
can manage. The most skilful cork(cid:173)
strippers prise away a semi-circular 
husk that runs the length of the trunk 
from just above ground level to the 
first branches . It is then dried on the 
ground for about four months, before 
being taken to factories, where it is 
boiled to kill any insects that might 
remain in the cork. Over 60% of 
cork then goes on to be made into 
traditional bottle stopp ers, with m ost 
of the rem a inder being used in the 
constr uction trade . Corkboard an d 
cork t iles ar e id ea l for t hermal an d 
acous t ic insul at ion, wh ile gra nul es of 
cork are us ed in th e manufacture of 
concrete . 

Recent years have seen the end of 
the virtual monopoly of cork as the 
material for bottle stoppers, due to 
concerns about the effect it may have 
on the contents of the bottle . This 

is caused by a chemical compound 
called 2,4,6 -trichloroanisole (TCA), 
which forms through the interaction 
of plant phenols, chlorine and mould . 
The tiniest concentrations - as little 
as three or four parts to a trillion -
can spoil the taste of the product 
contained in the bottle. The result 
has been a gradual yet steady move 
first towards plastic stoppers and, 
more recently , to aluminium screw 
caps. These substitutes are ch eaper to 
manufacture and, in the case of screw 
caps, more convenient for the user . 

The classic cork stopper does 
have several advantages, however. 
Firstly, its traditional image is more 
in keeping with that of the typ e of 
high qualit y goods with which it has 
long b een a ss ociat ed. Secondly -
and very impo r tan t ly - cork is a 
su stain a ble p r odu ct th at can b e 
recy cled witho ut difficulty. Mor eover, 
cor k for es t s a re a resource which 
support local biodiversity, and preven t 
desertification in the regions where 
th ey are planted. So, given the current 
concerns about environmental issues, 
the future of this ancient material 
once again looks promising.

t h em into co nta ct w it h li ke -minded people. 

An o th er mot iv e for co l lect ing is th e d es i re

If you th ink about collect ing postage

it - o r, perhaps, a resu lt of co ll ecting - is 
it s ed ucat ion a l va lue . St amp co ll ecting

Similarly, people who collect dolls may go 
beyond simply enlarging their collection, 
and deve lop an interest in the way that 
dolls are made, or the materials that 
are used. These have changed over the 
centuries from the wood that was standard 
in 16th century Europe, through the wax 
and porcelain of later centur ies, to the 
plastics of today's dolls. Or collectors 
might be inspired to study how dolls 
reflect notions of what children like, or 
ought to like. 

perhaps by country in alphabet ica l order, 
or grouping stamps by what they depict(cid:173)
people, birds, maps, and so on. 

One reason, conscious or not, for what 
someone chooses to collect is to show 
the collector's ind ividualism. Someone 
who decides to collect something as 
unexpected as dog collars, for instance, 
may be conveying their belief that they 
must be interesting themselves. And 
believe it or not, there is at least one dog 
collar museum in ex istence, and it grew out 
of a personal collection. 

Not all collectors are interested in learning 
from their hobby, t ho ugh, so wha t we 
might call a psychologica l reason for 
collecting 
is the need for a sense of 
control, perhaps as a way of dealing w ith 
insecurity. Stamp collectors, for instance, 
arrange their stamps in albums, usually very 
neatly, orga ni sing their co llect ion accord in g 
to certain commonp lac e pri ncip les -

Of course, all hobbies give pleasu re, but 
the common factor in collect in g is usually 
passion: pleasure is putting 
it far too 
mi ldly. More than most other hobb ies , 
co llec ting can be totally engrossing, 
and can give a strong sense of personal 
f ulfilment. To non-collec tors it may appear 
an eccen t ric, if harmless, way of spending 
time, but potentially, col lec t ing has a lot 
going for it.

Test5 

What's the purpose of gaining knowledge? 

A 

'I would found an institution where any person can find instruction 
in a ny 
subject.' That was the found er's motto for Cornell University, and it seems an apt 
characterization of the different university, also in rhe USA, where I currently teach 
philosophy. A student can prepare for a career in resort mana gem ent, engi neerin g, 
interior design, accounting, music, law enforc ement, yo u name it. But what would 
the founders of these two in st itution s have thought of a cou rse called 'Arson for Profit'? 
I kid you not: we have it on the books. Any undergr adu ates who have met the academic 
requirements ca n s ign up for the course in our program in 'fire science'. 

B Naturally, the co urse is int end ed for pro sp ective arson in vestigator s, who can learn all 
the tricks of th e trad e for d e tect ing whether a fire was deliberately set, di scove r ing who 
did it, and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law. 
But wouldn't this also b e the perfect course for pro spec tiv e a rso ni sts to sign up for? My 
point is not to criticize academic program s in fire science: they are hi ghly welcome as 
part of the increasii1g profe ssionaliz qtion of thi s and many other occupations. However, 
it 's not unknown for a firefighter to torch a building. 1his examp le su ggests how 
dishone st and illegal behavior, with th e help of. higher ed uc a tion , ca n creep into every 
aspect of publi c and busine ss life. 

C 

I realized this anew when I was invited to spea k before a class in m arketing, which is 
a noth er of our degree pro g rams. The regular in structor is a colleague who appreciates 
th e kind of et hi cal perspective I can brin g as a phil osop h er. There a re endless ways 
I cou ld hav e approac h ed this assignm e nt, but I took my cu e from th e titl e of the 
course: 'Prin c ipl es of Marketing '. It m ade me chink co ask the st udent s, 'ls m ark et in g 
princip led?' After a ll, a subj ect matter can have principles in the sense of being codified, 
havin g rules, as with football or chess, without being principl ed in the sense of being 
e thic al. Many of the students immediately assumed chat the answer co m y question 
ab out marketin g princip les was obvious : no. Just look at th e ways in whi ch every thing 
und er the sun h as b een mark eted; obviously it n eed not be do n e in a p rin cipled 
( =et hic al) fashion . 

D 

Is chat obvious? I mad e the sugges tion, which ma y sou nd downright cra zy in light of 
t h e ev iden ce, that perhaps marketing is by d efinition principled . My in sp ir at ion for this 
judgement 
is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that an y bod y of knowledge 
co n sists of an end (or purpos e) and a means .

Reading 

E Let us apply both the terms 'means' 
and 'end' to marketing. 
The students 
have signed 
up for a course 
in order to learn how to market effectively
. But to what encP. There seem 
to be two main attitudes 
toward that question. 
One is that the answer is obvious: 
the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is to sell things 
and to make money. The other attitude 
is that the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is irrelevant: 
Each person comes to the 
program 
and course 
with 
his or her own plans, 
and these need not even concern 
the acquisition 
of marketing 
expertise 
as such. My proposal, 
which I believe 
would also be Kane's, 
is that neither 
of 
these attitudes 
captures 
the significance of 
the end to the means for marketing. 
A field 
of knowledge 
or a professional 
endeavor 
is defined 
by both the means and the end; 
hence both deserve 
scrutiny. 
Students 
need to study both how to achieve 
X, and also 
what X is. 

F It is at this point that 'Arson 
for Profit' 
becomes 
supremely 
relevant. 
That course 
is 
presumably 
all about means: how to detect 
and prosecute criminal 
activity. 
It is therefore 
that the end is good in an ethical sense. 
assumed 
When I ask fire science 
students 
to 
articulate 
the end, or purpose, 
of their field, 
they eventually 
generalize 
to something 
like, 
'The safety 
and welfare of society,' which 
seems right. 
As we have seen, someone 
could 
use the very same knowledge 
of means to achieve 
a much less noble end, such as personal 
profit 
via destructive, 
dangerouS', 
reckless activity. 
But we would not call that fire.fightin
g. 
We have a separate 
word for it: arson. 
Similarly, 
if you. employed 
the 'principles 
of 
marketing' 
in an unprincipled 
way, you would not be doing marketing. We have another 
term for it: fraud. Kant gives the example 
of a doctor 
and a poisoner, 
who use the 
identical 
knowledge 
to achieve 
their divergent 
ends. We would say that one is practicing 
medicine, 
the other, 
murder.

READING PASSAGE 1 

You should spend about 20 minutes 
on Questions 
1-13, which are based on Reading 
Passage 1 below. 

The risks agriculture 
faces in developing 
countries 

Synthesis 
of an online 
debate* 

A Two things distinguish 
food production 
from all other productive 
activities: 
first, 
every single person needs food each day and has a right to it; and second, 
it is 
hugely dependent 
on nature. 
These two unique aspects, 
one political, 
the other 
natural, 
make food production 
highly 
vulnerable 
and different 
from any other 
business. 
At the same time, cultural 
values are highly entrenched 
in food and 
agricultural 
systems worldwide. 

B Farmers everywhere 
face major risks, 
including 
extreme weather, 
long-term 
climate 
change, and price volatility 
in input and product 
markets. 
However, 
smallholder 
farmers 
in developing 
countrie
s must in addition 
deal with adverse 
environments, 
both natural, 
in terms of soil quality, 
rainfall, 
etc., and human, in 
terms of infrastructure, 
financial 
systems, markets, 
knowledge 
and technology. 
Counter-intuitively, 
hunger is prevalent 
among many smallholder 
farmers 
in the 
developing 
world. 

C Participants 
in the online debate argued that our biggest 
challenge 
is to address the 
underlying 
causes of the agricultural 
system's 
inability 
to ensure sufficient 
food for 
all, and they identified 
as drivers 
of this problem our dependency 
on fossil 
fuels and 
unsupportive 
government 
policies. 

D On the question 
of mitigating 
the risks farmers 
face, most essayists 
called for 
greater 
state interventio
n. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President 
of the 
International 
Fund for Agricultural 
Development, 
argued that governments 
can 
significantly 
reduce risks for 
farmers 
by providing 
basic services like 
roads to get 
produce more efficiently 
to markets, 
or water and food 
storage facilities 
to reduce 
losses. 
Sophia Murphy, senior advisor 
to the Institute 
for Agriculture 
and Trade 
Policy, 
suggested 
that the procurement 
and holding 
of stocks by governments 
can also help mitigate 
wild swings in food prices by alleviating 
uncertainties 
about 
market supply. 

*The personal 
names in the text refer to the authors 
of written 
contributions 
to the online debate.

36 

Reading 

E Shenggen 
Fan, Director 
General 
of the International 
Food Policy 
Research 
Institute, 
held up social 
safety 
nets and public 
welfare 
programmes 
in Ethiopia, 
Brazil 
and Mexico as valuable 
ways to address 
poverty 
among farming 
families 
and reduce their vulnerability 
to agriculture 
shocks. 
However, 
some commentators 
responded 
that cash transfers 
to poor families 
do not necessarily 
translate 
into 
increased 
food security, as these programmes 
do not always strengthen 
food 
production 
or raise incomes. 
Regarding 
state subsidies 
for agriculture, 
Rokeya 
Kabir, 
Executive 
Director 
of Bangladesh 
Nari Progati 
Sangha, 
commented 
in her 
essay that these 'have not compensated 
for the stranglehold 
exercised 
by private 
traders. 
In fact, studies 
show that sixty percent 
of beneficiaries 
of subsidies 
are not 
poor, but rich landowners 
and non-farmer 
traders.' 

F Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private 
risk management 
tools, 
like private 
insurance, 
commodity 
futures 
markets, 
and rural finance 
can help small-scale 
producers 
mitigate 
risk and allow for investment 
in improvements. 
Kabir warned 
that financial 
support 
schemes often encourage 
the adoption 
of high-input 
agricultural 
practices, 
which in the medium term may raise production 
costs 
beyond the value of their harvests. 
Murphy noted that when futures 
markets 
become excessively 
financialised 
they can contribute 
to short-term 
price volatility, 
which increases 
farmers' 
food insecurity. 
Many participants 
and commentators 
emphasised 
that greater 
transparency 
in markets 
is needed to mitigate 
the impact 
of volatil
ity, and make evident 
whether 
adequate 
stocks and supplies 
are available. 
Others contended 
that agribusiness 
companies 
should be held responsible 
for 
paying for negative 
side effects. 

G Many essayists 
mentioned 
climate 
change and its consequences 
for small-scale 
agriculture. 
Fan explained 
that 'in addition 
to reducing 
crop yields, 
climate 
change 
increases 
the magnitude 
and the frequency 
of extreme 
weather 
events, 
which 
increase 
smallholder 
vulnerabili
ty.' The growing 
unpredictability 
of weather 
patterns 
increases 
farmers' 
difficulty 
in managing 
weather-related 
risks. 
According 
to this 
author, 
one solution 
would be to develop 
crop varieties 
that are more resilient 
to new climate 
trends and extreme 
weather 
patterns. 
Accordingly, 
Pat Mooney, 
co-founder and executive 
director 
of the ETC Group, suggested 
that 'if we are to 
survive 
climate 
change, 
we must adopt policies 
that let peasants 
diversify 
the plant 
and animal species 
and varieties/breeds 
that make up our menus.' 

37 

Test 6 

H Some participating 
authors 
and commentators 
argued in favour of community­
based and autonomous 
risk management 
strategies 
through 
collective 
action 
groups, 
co-operatives 
or producers' 
groups. 
Such groups enhance market 
opportunities 
for small-scale 
producers, 
reduce marketing 
costs and synchronise 
buying and selling 
with seasonal 
price conditions. 
According 
to Murphy, 
'collective 
action 
offers 
an important 
way for farmers 
to strengthen 
their political 
and economic 
bargaining 
power, and to reduce their business 
risks.' 
One commentator, 
Giel Ton, 
warned that collective 
action 
does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort 
and money to organise, 
build trust and to experiment. 
Others, 
like Marcel Vernooij 
and Marcel Beukeboom, 
suggested 
that in order to 'apply 
what we already 
know', 
all stakeholders, 
including 
business, 
government, 
scientists 
and civil society, 
must 
work together, 
starting 
at the beginning of 
the value chain. 

Some participants 
explained 
that market price volatility 
is often worsened 
by the 
of intermediary 
purchasers 
who, taking 
advantage 
of farmers' 
vulnerability, 
presence 
dictate 
prices. 
One commentator 
suggested 
farmers 
can gain greater 
control 
over 
prices 
and minimise 
price volatility 
by selling 
directly 
to consumers. 
Similarly, 
Sonali 
Bisht, 
founder 
and advisor 
to the Institute 
of Himalayan Environmental 
Research 
and Education 
(INHERE), 
India, 
wrote that community-supported 
agriculture, 
where 
consumers 
invest 
i'n local 
farmers 
by subscription 
and guarantee 
producers 
a fair 
price, 
is a risk-sharing 
model worth more attention. 
Direct 
food distribution 
systems 
not only encourage 
small-scale 
agriculture 
but also give consumers 
more control 
over the food they consume, 
she wrote.

The Lost City 

An explorer's 
encounter 
with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, 
the most famous 
icon of the Inca civilisation 

A When the US explorer 
and academic 
Hiram Bingham arrived 
in South America 
in 
1911, he was ready for what was to be the greatest 
achievement 
of his life: 
the 
exploration 
of the remote hinterland 
to the west of Cusco, the old capital 
of the Inca 
empire in the Andes mountains 
of Peru. His goal was to locate 
the remains 
of a city 
called 
Vitcos, 
the last capital 
of the Inca civilisation. 
Cusco lies on a high plateau 
at an elevation 
of more than 3,000 metres, 
and Bingham's 
plan was to descend 
from this plateau 
along the valley 
of the Urubamba 
river, 
which takes a circuitous 
route down to the Amazon and passes through 
an area of dramatic 
canyons 
and 
mountain 
ranges. 

B When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba 
in late July, they had 
an advantage 
over travellers 
who had preceded 
them: a track had recently 
been 
blasted 
down the valley 
canyon to enable rubber to be brought 
up by mules from 
the jungle. 
Almost all previous 
traveUers 
had left the river atOllantaytambo 
and 
taken a high pass across the mountains 
'to rejoin 
the river lower down, thereby 
cutting 
a substantial 
corner, 
but also therefore 
never passing 
through 
the area 
around Machu Picchu. 

C On 24 July they were a few days into their descent 
of the valley. 
The day began 
slowly, 
with Bingham trying 
to arrange 
sufficient 
mules for the next stage of the 
trek. His companions 
showed no interest 
in accompanying 
him up the nearby hill 
to see some ruins that a local farmer, 
Melchor 
Arteaga, 
had told them about the 
night before. 
The morning 
was dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have 
been less than keen on the prospect 
of climbing 
the hill. 
In his book Lost City of the 
Incas, 
he relates 
that he made the ascent without 
having the least expectation 
that 
he would find anything 
at the top. 

D Bingham writes 
about the approach 
in vivid style in his book. First, 
as he climbs 
up the hill, 
he describes 
the evet�present 
possibility 
of deadly snakes, 
'capable 
of 
making considerable 
springs 
when in pursuit 
of their prey'; 
not that he sees any. 
Then there's 
a sense of mounting 
discovery 
as he comes -across great sweeps 
of terraces, 
then a mausoleum, 
followed 
by monumental 
staircases 
and, finally, 
the grand ceremonial 
buildings 
of Machu Picchu. 
'It seemed like an unbelievable 
dream ... the sight held me spellbound 
... ' he wrote. 

43 

Test 6 

E We should remember, 
however, 
that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight, 
not written 
until 1948, many years after his journey. 
His journal 
entries 
of the 
time reveal a much more gradual 
appreciation 
of his achievement. 
He spent 
the afternoon 
at the ruins noting down the dimensions 
of some of the buildings, 
then descended 
and rejoined 
his companions, 
to whom he seems to have said 
little 
about his discovery. 
At this stage, Bingham didn't 
realise 
the extent or the 
importance 
of the site, nor did he realise 
what use he could make of the discovery. 

F However, 
soon after returning 
it occurred 
to him that he could make a name for 
from this discovery. 
When he came to write the National 
Geographic 
himself 
magazine 
article 
that broke the story to the world in April 1913, he knew he had 
to produce 
a big idea. He wondered 
whether 
it could have been the birthplace 
of 
the very first 
Inca, Manco the Great, and whether 
it could also have been what 
chroniclers 
described 
as 'the last city of the Incas'. 
This term refers 
to Vilcabamba, 
the settlement 
where the Incas had fled from Spanish 
invaders 
in the 1530s. 
Bingham made desperate 
attempts 
to prove this belief 
for nearly 40 years. Sadly, 
his vision 
of the site as both the beginning 
and end of the Inca civilisation, 
while 
a magnificent 
on.e, is inaccurate. 
We now know that Vilcabamba 
actually 
lies 65 
kilometres 
away in the depths of the jungle. 

G One question 
that has perplexed 
visitors, 
historians 
and archaeologists 
alike ever 
since Bingham, 
is why the site seems to have been abandoned 
before the Spanish 
Conquest. 
There are no references 
to it by any of the Spanish 
chroniclers 
-and if 
they had known of its existence 
so close to Cusco they would certainly 
have come 
in search of gold. An idea which has gained wide acceptance 
over the past few 
years is that Machu Picchu was a moya, a country 
estate built by an Inca emperor 
to escape the cold winters 
of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental 
architecture 
and spectacular 
views. Furthermore, 
the particular 
architecture 
of 
Machu Picchu suggests 
that it was constructed 
at the time of the greatest 
of all the 
Incas, 
the emperor Pachacuti 
(c. 1438-71 
). By custom, 
Pachacuti's 
descendants 
built other similar 
estates 
for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been 
abandoned 
after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish 
Conquest.

27-40, which are based on Reading 

The Benefits 
of Being Bilingual 

A According 
to the latest 
figures, 
the majority 
of the world's 
population 
is now bilingual 
or multilingual, 
having grown up speaking 
two or more languages. 
In the past, such 
children 
were considered 
to be at a disadvantage 
compared 
with their monolingual 
peers. Over the past few decades, 
however, technological 
advances 
have allowed 
researchers 
to look more deeply at how bilingualism 
interacts 
with and changes 
the cognitive 
and neurological 
systems, 
thereby 
identifying 
several 
clear benefits 
of 
being bilingual. 

B Research 
shows that when a bilingual 
person uses one language, 
the other is 
active 
at the same time. When we hear a word, we don't hear the entire 
word all at 
once: the sounds arrive 
in sequential 
order. 
Long before the word is finished, 
the 
brain's 
language 
system begins to guess what that word might be. If you hear 'can', 
you will likely 
activate 
words like 'candy' 
and 'candle' 
as werl, at least during the 
earlier 
stages of word recognition. 
For bilingual 
people, 
this activation 
is not limited 
to a single 
language; 
auditory 
input activates 
corresponding 
words regardless 
of the language 
to which they belong. 
Some of the most compelling 
evidence 
for this phenomenon, 
called 
'language 
co-activation', 
comes from studying 
eye 
movements. 
A Russian-English 
bilingual 
asked to 'pick up a marker' 
from a set of 
objects 
would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn't 
know Russian, 
because the Russian 
word for 'stamp', 
marka, sounds like the English 
word he or 
she heard, 'marker'. 
In cases like this, language 
co-activation 
occurs because what 
the listener 
hears could map onto words in either 
language. 

C Having to deal with this persistent 
linguistic 
competition 
can result 
in difficulties, 
however. 
For instance, 
knowing 
more than one language 
can cause speakers 
to 
name pictures 
more slowly, and can increase 
'tip-of-the-tongue 
states', 
when you 
can almost, 
but not quite, 
bring a word to mind. As a result, 
the constant 
juggling 
of 
two languages 
creates 
a need to control 
how much a person accesses 
a language 
at any given time. For this reason, 
bilingual 
people often perform 
better 
on tasks 
that require 
conflict 
management. 
In the classic 
Stroop Task, people see a word 
and are asked to name the colour of the word's font. When the colour and the 
word match (i.e., 
the word 'red' printed 
in red), people correctly 
name the colour 
more quickly 
than when the colour and the word don't match (i.e., 
the word 'red' 
printed 
in blue). 
This occurs because the word itself 
('red') 
and its font colour (blue) 
conflict. 
Bilingual 
people often excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability 
to ignore competing 
perceptual 
information 
and focus on the relevant 
aspects 
of 
the input. 
Bilinguals 
are also better 
at switching 
between two tasks; 
for example, 
when bilinguals 
have to switch from categorizing 
objects 
by colour (red or green) 

46 

Reading 

to ·categorizing 
them by shape (circle 
or triangle), 
they do so more quickly 
than 
monolingual 
people, 
reflecting 
better 
cognitive 
control 
when having to make rapid 
cl1anges of strategy. 

D It also seems that the neurological 
roots of the bilingual 
advantage 
extend to brain 
ar-eas more traditionally 
associated 
with sensory 
processing. 
When monolingual 
and bilingual 
adolescents 
listen 
to simple speech sounds without 
any intervening 
background 
noise, 
they show highly 
similar 
brain stem responses. 
When 
researchers 
play the same sound to both groups in the presence 
of background 
noise, 
however, 
the bilingual 
listeners' 
neural 
response 
is considerably 
larger, 
reflecting 
better 
encoding 
of the sound's 
fundamental 
frequenc
y, a feature 
of sound 
closely 
related 
to pitch perception. 

E Such improvements 
in cognitive 
and sensory 
processing 
may help a bilingual 
person to process 
information 
in the environment, 
and help explain 
why bilingual 
adults 
acquire 
a third language 
better 
than monolingual 
adults 
master a second 
language. 
This advantage 
may be rooted in the skill 
of focussing 
on information 
about the new language 
while reducing 
interference 
from the languages 
they 
al ready know. 

F Research 
also indicates 
that bilingual 
experience 
may help to keep the cognitive 
mechanisms 
sharp by recruiting 
alternate 
brain networks 
to compensate 
for those 
that become damaged during 
aging. 
Older bilinguals 
enjoy improved 
memory 
relative 
to monolingual 
people, 
which can lead to real-world 
health 
benefits. 
In a 
study of over 200 patients 
with Alzheimer's 
disease, 
a degenerative 
brain disease, 
bilingual patients 
reported 
showing 
initial 
symptoms 
of the disease 
an average 
of five years later than monolingual 
patients. 
In a follow-up 
study, researchers 
compared 
the brains 
of bilingual 
and monolingual 
patients 
matched on the severity 
of Alzheimer's 
symptoms. 
Surprisingly, 
the bilinguals' 
brains 
had more physical 
signs of disease 
than their monolingual 
counterparts, 
even though their outward 
behaviour 
and abilities 
were the same. If the brain is an engine, 
bilingualism 
may 
help it to go farther 
on the same amount of fuel. 

G Furthermore, 
the benefits 
associated 
with bilingual 
experience 
seem to start 
very early. In one study, 
researchers 
taught 
seven-month-old 
babies growing 
up·in monolingual 
or bilingual 
homes that when they heard a tinkling 
sound, a 
puppet appeared 
on one side of a screen. 
Halfway 
through 
the study, 
the puppet 
began appearing 
on the opposite 
side of the screen. 
In order to get a reward, 
the 
infants 
had to adjust 
the rule they'd 
learned; 
only the bilingual 
babies were able to 
successfully 
learn the new rule. This suggests 
that for very young children, 
as well 
as for older people, 
navigating 
a multilingual 
environment 
imparts 
advantages 
that 
transfer 
far beyond language.

Flying tortoises 

An airborne 
reintroduction 
programme 
has helped conservationists 
take 
significant 
steps to protect 
the endangered 
Galapagos tortoise. 

A Forests 
of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains 
that separate 
the 
of the Galapagos 
island 
of lsabela 
from the Pacific 
Ocean. With its 
interior 
five distinct volcanoes, the 
island 
resembles 
a lunar landscape. 
Only the thick 
vegetation 
at the skirt of the often cloud-covered 
peak of Sierra Negra offers 
respite 
from the barren terrain below. 
This inhospitable 
environment 
is home to the giant 
Galapagos 
tortoise. Some 
time after the Galapagos's 
birth, 
around five 
million 
y ears ago, the islands 
were colonised 
by one or more tortoises 
from mainland 
South America. 
As these ancestral 
tortoises 
settled 
on the individual 
islands, 
the 
different 
populations adapted 
to their unique environments, 
giving 
rise to at least 
14 different subspecies. 
Island 
life agreed with them. In the absence of significant 
predators, 
they grew to become the largest 
and longest-living 
tortoises 
on the 
planet, 
weighing 
more than 400 kilograms, 
occasionally 
exceeding 
1.8 metres in 
length and living 
for more than a century. 

8 Before human arrival, 
the archipelago's 
tortoises 
numbered 
in the hundreds 
of thousands. 
From the 17th century 
onwards, 
pirates 
took a few on board for 
food, but the arrival 
of whaling 
ships in the 1790s saw this exploitation 
grow 
exponentially. 
Relatively 
immobile 
and capable 
of surviving 
for months without food 
or water, the tortoises 
were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies 
during long ocean passages. 
Sometimes, 
their bodies were processed 
into high­
grade oil. In total, 
an estimated 
200,000 animals 
were taken from the archipelago 
before the 20th century. 
This historical 
exploitation 
was then exacerbated 
when 
settlers 
came to the islands. 
They hunted the tortoises 
and destroyed 
their habitat 
to clear land for agriculture. 
They also introduced 
alien species 
-ranging 
from 
cattle, 
pigs, goats, rats and dogs to plants and ants -that either 
prey on the eggs 
and young tortoises 
or damage or destroy 
their habitat. 

C Today, only 11 of the original 
subspecies 
survive 
and of these, several 
are highly 
endangered. 
In 1989, work began on a tortoise-breeding 
centre just outside 
the 
town of Puerto Villamil 
on lsabela, 
dedicated 
to protecting 
the island's 
tortoise 
populations. 
The centre's 
captive-breeding 
programme 
proved to be extremely 
successful, 
and it eventually 
had to deal with 
an overpopulation 
problem. 

D The problem 
was also a pressing 
one. Captive-bred 
tortoises 
can't be reintroduced 
into the wild until they're 
at least five years old and weigh at least 4.5 kilograms, 
at which point their size and weight -and their hardened 
shells 
-are sufficient 
to protect 
them from predators. 
But if people wait too long after that point, 
the 
tortoises 
eventually 
become too large to transport. 

60 

Reading 

E For years, repatriation 
efforts 
were carried 
out in small numbers, 
with the tortoises 
carried 
on the backs of men over weeks of long, treacherous 
hikes along narrow 
trails. 
But in November 
2010, the environmentalist 
and Galapagos 
National 
Park 
liaison 
officer 
Godfrey 
Merlin, 
a visiting 
private 
motor yacht captain 
and a helicopter 
pilot gathered 
around a table in a small cafe in Puerto Ayora on the island 
of Santa 
Cruz to work out more ambitious 
reintroduction. 
The aim was to use a helicopter 
to move 300 of the breeding 
centre's 
tortoises 
to various 
locations 
close to Sierra 
Negra. 

F This unprecedented 
effort 
was made possible 
by the owners of the 67-metre 
yacht White Cloud, who provided 
the Galapagos 
National 
Park with free use of 
their helicopter 
and its experienced 
pilot, 
as well as the logistical 
support 
of the 
yacht, its captain 
and crew. Originally 
an air ambulance, 
the yacht's 
helicopter 
has a rear double door and a large internal 
space that's 
well suited 
for cargo, 
so a custom crate was designed 
to hold up to 33 tortoises 
with a total weight of 
about 150 kilograms. 
This weight, 
together 
with that of the fuel, pilot and four crew, 
approached 
the helicopter's 
maximum payload, 
and there were times when it was 
clearly 
right on the edge of the helicopter's 
capabilities. 
During a period of three 
days, a group of volunteers 
from the breeding 
centre worked around the clock to 
prepare 
the young tortoises 
for transport. 
Meanwhile, 
park wardens, 
dropped 
off 
ahead of time in remote locations, 
cleared 
landing 
sites within 
the thick brush, cacti 
and lava rocks. 

G Upon their release, 
the juvenile 
tortoises 
quickly 
spread out over their ancestral 
territory, investigating 
their new surroundings 
and feeding 
on the vegetation. 
Eventually, 
one tiny tortoise 
came across a fully grown giant who had been 
lumbering 
around the island 
for around a hundred years. The two stood side by 
side, a powerful 
symbol of the regeneration 
of an ancient 
species.

The Intersection 
of Health Sciences 
and Geography 

A While many diseases 
that affect 
humans have been eradicated 
due to 
improvements 
in vaccinations 
and the availability 
of healthcare, 
there are still 
areas 
around the world where certain 
health issues are more prevalent. 
In a world that is 
far more globalised 
than ever before, 
people come into contact 
with one another 
through 
travel 
and living 
closer 
and closer to each other. 
As a result, 
super-viruses 
and other infections 
resistant 
to antibiotics 
are becoming 
more and more common. 

B Geography 
can often play a very large role in the health concerns 
of certain 
populations. 
For instance, 
depending 
on where you live, you will not have the same 
health concerns 
as someone who lives in a different 
geographical 
region. 
Perhaps 
one of the most obvious 
examples 
of this idea is malaria-prone 
areas, which are 
usually 
tropical 
regions 
that foster 
a warm and damp environment 
in which the 
mosquitos 
that can give people this disease 
can grow. Malarip 
is much less of a 
problem 
in high-altitude 
deserts, 
for instance. 

C In some countries, 
geographical 
factors 
influence 
the health and well-being 
of 
the population 
in very obvious 
ways. In many large cities, 
the wind is not strong 
enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution 
that cause 
asthma, 
lung problems, 
eyesight 
issues and more in the people who live there. 
Part 
of the problem 
is, of course, 
the massive number of cars being driven, 
in addition 
to factories 
that run on coal power. The rapid industrialisation 
of some countries 
in 
recent years has also led to the cutting 
down of forests 
to allow for the expansion 
of 
big cities, 
which makes it even harder to fight the pollution 
with the fresh air that is 
produced 
by plants. 

D It is in situations 
like these that the field of health geography 
comes into its own. It 
is an increasingly 
important 
area of study in a world where diseases 
like polio are 
re-emerging,-
respiratory 
diseases 
continue 
to spread, 
and malaria-prone 
areas 
are still 
fighting 
to find a better 
cure. Health geography 
is the combination 
of, on 
the one hand, knowledge 
regarding 
geography 
and methods used to analyse 
and -­
interpret 
geographical 
information, 
and on the other, 
the study of health, 
diseases 
and healthcare 
practices 
around the world. The aim of this hybrid science 
is to 
create solutions 
for common geography-based 
health problems. 
While people will 
always be prone to illness, 
the study of how geography 
affects 
our health could 
lead to the eradication 
of certain 
illnesses, 
and the prevention 
of others in the 
future. 
By understanding 
why and how we get sick, we can change the way we 
treat illness 
and disease 
specific 
to certain 
geographical 
locations. 

63 

Test 7 

E The geography 
of disease 
and ill health analyses 
the frequency 
with which certain 
diseases 
appear in different 
parts of the world, and overlays 
the data with the 
geography 
of the region, 
to see if there could be a correlation 
between the two. 
Health geographers 
also study factors 
that could make certain 
individuals 
or a 
population 
more likely 
to be taken ill with a specific 
health concern 
or disease, 
as 
compared 
with the population 
of another 
area. Health geographers 
in this field 
are usually 
trained 
as healthcare 
workers, 
and have an understanding 
of basic 
epidemiology 
as it relates 
to the spread of diseases 
among the population. 

F Researchers 
study the interactions 
between humans and their environment 
that 
could lead to illness 
(such as asthma in places with high levels 
of pollution) 
and 
work to create a clear way of categorising 
illnesses, 
diseases 
and epidemics 
into 
local and global 
scales. 
Health geographers 
can map the spread of illnesses 
and 
attempt 
to identify 
the reasons 
behind an increase 
or decrease 
in illnesses, 
as 
they work to find a way to halt the further 
spread or re-emergence 
of diseases 
in 
vulnerable 
populations. 

G The second subcategory 
of health geography 
is the geography 
of healthcare 
provision. 
This group studies 
the availability 
(or lack thereof) 
of healthcare 
resources 
to individuals 
and populafrons 
around the world. In both developed 
and 
developing 
nations 
there is often a very large discrepancy 
between the options 
available 
to people in different 
social 
classes, 
income brackets, 
and levels 
of 
education. 
Individuals 
working 
in the area of the geography 
of healthcare 
provision 
attempt 
to assess the levels 
of healthcare 
in the area (for instance, 
it may be very 
difficult 
for people to get medical 
attention 
because there is a mountain 
between 
their village 
and the nearest 
hospital). 
These researchers 
are on the frontline 
of 
making recommendations 
regarding 
policy 
to international 
organisations, 
local 
government 
bodies and others. 

H The field of health geography 
is often overlooked, 
but it constitutes 
a huge area 
of need in the fields 
of geography 
and healthcare. 
If we can understand 
how 
geography 
affects 
our health no matter where in the world we are located, 
we can 
better 
treat disease, 
prevent 
illness, 
and keep people safe and well.

Passage 3.

Music and the emotions 

Neuroscientist 
Jonah Lehrer considers 
the emotional 
power of music 

Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, 
music is a purely abstract 
art form, 
devoid of language 
or explicit 
ideas. 
And yet, even though music says little, 
it still 
manages to touch us deeply. When listening 
to our favourite 
songs, our body betrays 
all 
the symptoms 
of emotional 
arousal. 
The pupils 
in our eyes dilate, our 
pulse and blood 
pressure 
rise, the electrical 
conductance 
of our skin is lowered, 
and the cerebellum, 
a 
brain region associated 
with bodily 
movement, 
becomes strangely 
active. 
Blood is even 
re-directed 
to the 
muscles 
in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological 
roots. 

A recent paper in Nature Neuroscience 
by a research 
team in Montreal, 
Canada, marks 
an important 
step in revealing 
the precise 
1.mderpinnings 
of 'the potent pleasurable 
stimulus' 
that is music. Although 
the study involves 
plenty 
of fancy technology, 
including 
functional 
magnetic resonance 
imaging 
(fMRI) and ligand-based 
positron 
emission 
tomography 
(PET) scanning, 
the experiment 
itself 
was rather straightforward. 
After 
screening 
217 individuals 
who responded 
to advertisements 
requesting 
people who 
experience 
'chills' 
to instrumental 
music, the scientists 
narrowed 
down the subject 
pool 
to ten. They then asked the subjects 
to bring in their playlist 
of favourite 
songs -virtually 
every genre was represented, 
from techno to tango -and played them the music while 
their brain activity 
was monitored. 
Because the scientists 
were combining 
methodologies 
(PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively 
exact and detailed 
portrait 
of 
music in the brain. 
The first 
thing they discovered 
is that music triggers 
the production 
of dopamine 
- a chemical 
with a key role in setting 
people's 
moods -by the neurons 
(nerve cells) 
in both the dorsal and ventral 
regions 
of the brain. 
As these two regions 
have long been linked 
with the experience 
of pleasure, 
this finding 
isn't particularly 
surprising. 

What is rather 
more significant 
is the finding 
that the dopamine 
neurons 
in the 
caudate 
- a region of the brain involved 
in learning 
stimulus-response 
associations, 
and in anticipating 
food and other 'reward' 
stimuli 
-were at their most active 
around 
15 seconds before the participants' 
favourite 
moments in the music. The researchers 
call this the 'anticipatory 
phase' and argue that the purpose 
of this activity 
is to help 
us predict 
the arrival 
of our 
favourite 
part. The question, 
of course, 
is what all these 
dopamine 
neurons are up 
to. Why are they so 
active 
in the period preceding 
the 
acoustic 
climax? After all, 
we typically 
associate surges 
of dopamine 
with pleasure, 
with 
the processing 
of actual 
rewards. 
And yet, this cluster 
of cells is most active 
when the 
'chills' have yet 
to arrive, 
when the melodic 
pattern 
is still 
unresolved. 

66 

Reading 

One way to answer the question 
is to look at the music and not the neurons. 
While 
music can often seem (at least to the outsider) 
like a labyrinth 
of intricate 
patterns, 
it 
turns out that the most important 
part of every song or symphony 
is when the patterns 
break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. 
If the music is too obvious, 
it is 
annoyingly 
boring, 
like an alarm clock. 
Numerous 
studies, 
after all, have demonstrated 
that dopamine 
neurons 
quickly 
adapt to predictable 
rewards. 
If we know what's going 
to happen next, then we don't get excited. 
This is why composers 
often introduce 
a 
key note in the beginning 
of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious 
avoidance 
of the pattern, 
and then finally 
repeat it only at the end. The longer 
we are 
denied the pattern 
we expect, 
the greater 
the emotional 
release 
when the pattern 
returns, 
safe and sound. 

To demonstrate 
this psychological 
principle, 
the musicologist 
Leonard 
Meyer, in his 
book Emotion 
and Meaning in Music (1956), 
analysed 
the 5th movement 
of 
classic 
Beethoven's 
String 
Quartet 
in C-sharp 
minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how 
music is defined 
by its flirtation 
with -but not submission 
to -our expectations 
of order. 
Meyer dissected 
50 measures 
(bars) 
of the masterpiece, 
showing 
how Beethoven 
begins with the clear statement 
of a rhythmic 
and harmonic 
pattern 
and then, in an 
ingenious 
tonal dance, carefully 
holds off repeating 
it. What Beethoven 
does instead 
is 
suggest 
variations 
of th� pattern. 
He wants to preserve 
an element 
of uncertainty 
in his 
music, making our brains 
beg for the one chord he refuses 
to give us. Beethoven 
saves 
that chord for the end. 

According 
to Meyer, it is the suspenseful 
tension 
of music, arising 
out of our unfulfilled 
expectations, 
that is the source of the music's 
feeling. 
While earlier 
theories 
of music 
focused 
on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences 
-its 
'connotative' 
meaning 
-Meyer argued that the emotions 
we find in music come from the 
unfolding 
events of the music itself. 
This 'embodied 
meaning' 
arises 
from the patterns 
the symphony 
invokes 
and then ignores. 
It is this uncertainty 
that triggers 
the surge 
of dopamine 
in the caudate, 
as we struggle 
to figure 
out what will happen next. We 
can predict 
some of the notes, 
but we can't predict 
them all, and that is what keeps us 
listening, 
waiting 
expectantly 
for our reward, 
for the pattern 
to be completed.

UK companies 
need more effective 
boards of directors 

A After a number of serious 
failures 
of governance 
(that is, how they are managed 
at the highest 
level), 
companies 
in Britain, 
as well as elsewhere, 
should consider 
radical 
changes 
to their directors' 
roles. 
It is clear that the role of a board director 
today is not an easy one. Following 
the 2008 financial 
meltdown, 
which resulted 
in 
a deeper and more prolonged 
period 
of economic 
downturn 
than anyone expected, 
the search for explanations 
in the many post-mortems 
of the crisis 
has meant 
blame has been spread far and wide. Governments, 
regulators, 
central 
banks and 
auditors 
have all been in the frame. The role of bank directors 
and management 
and their widely publicised 
failures 
have been extensively 
picked over and 
examined 
in reports, 
inquiries 
and commentaries. 

B The knock-on 
effect of this scrutiny 
has been to make the governance 
of 
companies 
in general 
an issue of intense 
public 
debate and has significantly 
increased 
the pressures 
on, and the responsibilities 
of, directors. 
At the simplest 
and most practical 
level, 
the time involved 
in fulfilling 
the demands of a board 
directorship 
has increased 
signific
antly, calling 
into question 
the effectiveness 
of 
the classic 
model of corporate 
governance 
by part-time, 
independent 
non-executive 
directors. 
Where once a board schedule 
may have consisted 
of between 
eight and 
ten meetings 
a year, in many companies 
the number of events requiring 
board 
input and decisions 
has dramatically 
risen. 
Furthermore, 
the amount of reading 
and preparation 
required 
for each meeting 
is increasing. 
Agendas can become 
overloaded 
and this can mean the time for constructive 
debate must necessarily 
be 
restricted 
in favour of getting 
through 
the business. 

C Often, board business 
is devolved 
to committees 
in order to cope with the 
workload, 
which may be more efficient 
but can mean that the board as a whole 
is less involved 
in fully addressing 
some of the most important 
issues. 
It is not 
uncommon for the audit committee 
meeting 
to last longer 
than the main board 
meeting 
itself. 
Process 
may take the place of discussion 
and be at the expense 
of 
real collaboration, 
so that boxes are ticked 
rather 
than issues 
tackled. 

D A radical 
solution, 
which may work for some very large companies 
whose 
businesses 
are extensive 
and complex, 
is the professional 
board, whose members­
would work up to three or four days a week, supported 
by their own dedicated 
staff 
and advisers. 
There are obvious 
.. risks to this-and it would be important 
to establish 
clear guidelines 
for such a board to ensure that it did not step on the toes of 
management 
by becoming 
too engaged in the day-to-day 
running 
of the company. 
Problems 
of recruitment, 
remuneration 
and independence 
could also arise and this 
structure 
would not be appropriate 
for all companies. 
However, 
more professional 
and better-inf
ormed boards would have been particularly 
appropriate 
for banks 
had access to information 
where the executives 
that part-time 
non-executive 
directors 
lacked, 
leaving 
the latter 
unable to comprehend 
or anticipate 
the 2008 
crash. 

89 

Test 8 

E One of the main criticisms 
of boards and their directors 
is that they do not focus 
sufficiently 
on longer-term 
matters 
of strategy, 
sustainability 
and governance, 
but instead 
concentrate 
too much on short-term 
financial 
metrics. 
Regulatory 
requirements 
and the structure 
of the market encourage 
this behaviour. 
The tyranny 
of quarterly 
reporting 
can distort 
board decision-making, 
as directors 
have to 'make 
the numbers' 
every four months to meet the insatiable 
appetite 
of the market for 
more data. This serves to encourage 
the trading 
methodology 
of a certain 
kind of 
investor 
who moves in and out of a stock without 
engaging 
in constructive 
dialogue 
with the company about strategy 
or performance, 
and is simply seeking 
a short­
term financial 
gain. This effect 
has been made worse by the changing 
profile 
of 
investors 
due to the globalisation 
of capital 
and the increasing 
use of automated 
trading 
systems. 
Corporate 
culture 
adapts and management 
teams are largely 
incentivised 
to meet financial 
goals. 

F Compensation 
for chief executives 
has become a combat zone where pitched 
battles 
between investors, 
management 
and board members are fought, 
often 
behind closed doors but increasingly 
frequently 
in the full glare of press attention. 
Many would argue that this is in the interest 
of transparency 
and good governance 
as shareholders 
use their muscle in, the area of pay to pressure 
boards to 
remove underperforming 
chief executives. 
Their powers to vote down executive 
remuneration 
policies 
increased 
when binding 
votes came into force. 
The chair 
of the remuneration 
committee 
can be an exposed and lonely 
role, as Alison 
Carnwath, 
chair of Barclays 
Bank's remuneration 
committee, 
found when she had 
to resign, 
having been roundly 
criticised 
for trying 
to defend the enormous 
bonus 
to be paid to the chief executive; 
the irony being that she was widely understood 
to 
have spoken out against 
it in the privacy 
of the committee. 

G The financial 
crisis 
stimulated 
a debate about the role and purpose 
of the company 
and a heightened 
awareness 
of corporate 
ethics. 
Trust in the corporation 
has been 
eroded and academics 
such as Michael 
Sandel, 
in his thoughtful 
and bestselling 
book What Money Can't Buy, are questioning 
the morality 
of capitalism 
and the 
market economy. Boards of companies 
in all sectors 
will need to widen their 
perspective 
to encompass 
these issues and this may involve 
a realignment 
of 
corporate 
goals. 
We live in challenging 
times.

TC EMPLOYEE: 
Hi. Can I help you? 
vIsITOR: I'd like to find out if you have any excursions 
suitable 
for families. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. How about taking 
your family 
for a cruise? 
We have a steamship 
takes passengers 
out several 
times a day -it's over 100 years old. 
VISITOR: That sounds interesting. 
How long is the trip? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
About an hour and a half. And don't forget 
to take pictures 
of the mountains.

vIsIToR: OK. And I assume there's

TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. How old are your children? 
vIs1TOR: Er, my daughter's 
fifteen

TC EMPLOYEE: 
Right. 
Well there are various 
things 
you can do once you've crossed 
the lake, 
to make a day of it. One thing that's 
very popular 
is a visit 
to the Country 
Farm. 
You're 
met off the boat by the farmer and he'll 
take you to the holding 
pens, 
where the sheep are kept. Children 
love feeding 
them! 
vIsITOR: My son would love that. He really 
likes animals. 
Tc EMPLOYEE: 
Well, there's 
also a 40-minute 
trek round the farm on a horse, 
if he wants. 02 
vIsIToR: Do you think he'd manage it? He hasn't 
done that before. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. It's suitable 
for complete 
beginners. 
vIsITOR: Ah, good. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
And again, 
visitors 
are welcome to explore 
the farm on their own, as long 
as th�y take care to close gates and so on. There are some very beautiful 03 
gardens 
along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm -they'll 
be 
just at their best now. You could easily 
spend an hour or two there. 
vIsITOR: OK. Well that all sounds good. And can we get lunch there? 
04 
You can, and it's very good, though it's not included 
in the basic cost. You pay 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
when you get there. 
VISITOR: Right. 

vIsITOR: So is there anything 
else to do over on that side of the lake? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling 
tril?'. There's 
a _trail 
ther.e 
called 
the Back �oad -: you could ea?ily 
spen_9 
three 
or four hours exploring 
it, and the scenery's 
wonderful. 
They'll 
give you a map 05 
when you get your ticket 
for the cruise

no extra charge. 
vIsITOR: What's the trail

Quite challenging 
in places. 
It wouldn't

loves cycling

could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm. That might work out 
quite well. But we don't have bikes here ... is there somewhere 
we could 
rent them? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Yes, there's

It's called

TC EMPLOYEE:

VISITOR: OK. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
You'd also need to pick up a repair 
kit for the bike from there to take along 
with 
you, and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -it'd be best to get 
those in the city. 
vIsIToR: Fine. That shouldn't 
be a problem. 
And I assume I can rent a helmet from the QB 
bike place? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure, you should definitely 
get that. It's a great ride, but you want to be well 
prepared 
because it's very remote -you won't see any shops round there, 
or Q9 
anywhere 
to stay. so you need to get back in time for the last boat. 
vIsITOR: Yeah. So what sort of prices 
are we looking 
at here? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Let's see, that'd 
be one adult and one child for the cruise 
with farm tour, 
that's 
$117, and an adult and a child for the cruise 
only so that's $214 
dollars 
altogether. 
Oh, wait a minute, 
how old did you say your daughter 
was? 
VISITOR: Fifteen. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Then I'm afraid it's 
$267 because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75 Q10

SECTION 2 

Good morning 
everyone. 
My name's Joy Parkins 
and I'm the restaurant 
manager. 
And I 
understand 
that none of you've had any previous 
experience 
as kitchen 
assistants? 
Well, 
you might be feeling 
a bit nervous 
now, but most of our kitchen assistants 
say they enjoy the 
work. OK, they might get shouted 
at sometimes, 
but it's nothing 
personal, 
and they're 
pleased 
that they have so many different 
things to do, which means they never get bored. And I'll 
tell you straightaway 
that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving 
you 
some more responsibility. 

Q11 

Right, 
well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent 
start. 
Now I'm glad to see none 
of you have unsuitable 
footwear, 
so that's good 
-you need to be careful 
as the floors 
can get 
very wet and slippery. 
Those of you with long hair 
have got it well out of the way, but some 
of 
you'll 
need to remove your rings and bracelets 
-just put them somewhere 
safe for today, and 
remember 
to leave them at home tomorrow, as 
they can be a safety 
hazard. 

Q12 

Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -we don't have any tables 
free for this 
evening, 
and only a few for lunch. Fortunately 
we've got our Head Chef back -he was away 
on holiday 
all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work. Now, I'll tell you a bit 
more about the job in a minute but first, 
some general 
regulations. 
For all of you, whatever 
your age, there's 
some equipment 
you mustn't 
use until you've been properly 
trained, like 
the waste disposal system 
for example, 
for health and safety reasons. 
Then I think there are 
two of you here who are 
under 18 -that's 
Emma and Jake, isn't it? Right. 
so for you two, the 
meat slicer 
is out of bounds. 
And of course none of you are allowed 
to use the electric 
mixer 
until you've been shown how it works.

and carrying, 
so 
if you're not fit now you soon will be! You'll find 
you don't have 
much chance to take it easy -

to him and he'll make sure the incident 
is recorded 
and you get the appropriate treatment. 
He's trained 
to give basic treatment 
to 
staff himself, 
or he'll send 
you off somewhere 
else if necessary. 
Then there's 
Dexter Wills 
he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something 
like that. Don't just leave 
it and hope no one will notice 
-it's really 
important 
to get things 
noted and replaced 
or there 
could be problems 
later. 
And finally, 
there's 
Mike Smith. He's the member of staff who takes Q20
care of all the stores 
of perishables. 
so if you notice 
we're getting 
low in flour or sugar or 
something. 
make sure you let him know so he can put 
in an order.

SECTION 3 

TRUDIE: OK, Stewart. 
We need to start planning 
our paper on public 
libraries. 
Have you 
thought 
of an angle yet? 
STEWART: Well, there's 
so much we could look into. How libraries 
have changed 
over the 
centuries, 
for instance, 
or how different 
countries 
organise 
them. What do you
think, 
Trudie? 
TRUDIE: Maybe we should concentrate 
on.this country, 
and try and relate 
the changes 
libraries 
to external 
developments. 
like the fact that far 
more people can read than 
a century ago, and that the local population 
may speak lots of different 
languages. 
STEWART: We could include 
something 
about changes 
in the source of funding, 
too. 
TRUDIE: Yes, but remember 
we're only supposed 
to write a short paper, 
so it's probably 
best if we don't go into funding 
in any detail. 
Well, shall we just brainstorm 
a few ideas, 
to get started? 
TRUDIE: OK. We obviously 
need to look at the impact of new technology, 
particularly 
the 
internet. 
Now that lots of books have been digitalised, 
people can access them 
from their own computers 
at home. 
STEWART: And if everyone 
did that, libraries 
would be obsolete. 

STEWART: Right. 

in Q21 

TRUDIE: Yes. 

Q22 

TRUDIE: That's 

STEWART: But the digitalised 
books that are available 
on line for free are mostly out of 
copyright. 
aren't 
they? And copyright 
in this country lasts for 70 years after the 
author dies. So you won't find the latest 
best-seller 
or up-to-date 
information.

point.Aoyway,

I'd much rather 
read a physical 
book. And it takes longer 
to 
read on a screen. 
STEWART: Oh, I prefer 
it. I suppose 
it's just a personal 
preference. 
TRUDIE: Mm. I expect that libraries 
will go on evolving 
in the next few years. 
Some have 
already 
become centres 
where community 
activities 
take place, 
like local clubs 
meeting 
there. 
I think that'll 
become even more common. 
STEWART: I'd like to think so, and that they'll 
still 
be serving 
their traditional 
function, 
but I'm 
not so sure. There are financial 
implications, 
after all. What I'm afraid 
will happen is Q23
that books and magazines 
will all disappear. 
and there'll 
just be rows and rows of 
computers. 
They won't look anything 
like the libraries we're 
used to. 
TRUDIE: Well, we'll see. 

97 

Audioscripts 

TRUDIE: Right. 

TRUDIE: I've just had an idea. Why don't we make an in-depth 
study of our local public 
library 
as background 
to our paper? 
STEWART: Yes, that'd 
be interesting, 
and raise all sorts of issues. 
Let's make a list of possible 
things 
we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure. 
For instance, 
um. Q24
we could interview 
some of the staff, 
and find out whether 
the library 
has its own 
budget, 
or if that's 
controlled 
by the local council. 
TRUDIE: And what their policies 
are. I know they don't allow food, but I'd love to find out 
what types of noise they ban -there always seems to 
be a lot of talking, 
but never 
music. I don't know if that's 
a policy 
or it just happens. 
STEWART: Ah, I've often 
wondered. 
Then there are things 
like how the library 
is affected 
by Q25 
employment 
laws. I suppose there are rules about working 
hours, facilities for 
staff, 
and so on. 
Then there are other issues relating 
to the design of the building 
and how Q26 
customers use 
it. Like what measures does the 
library 
take to ensure their safety? 
They'd need floor coverings 
that aren't 
slippery, 
and emergency exits, 
for instance. 
Oh, and another 
thing -there's 
the question 
of the kind of insurance 
the library Q27
needs to have, in case anyone gets injured. 
STEWART: Yes, that's 
something 
else to find out. You know something 
I've often wondered? 
TRUDIE What's that? 
STEWART: Well, you know they've 
got an archive 
of local newspapers 
going back years? Well, 
next to it they've 
got the diary of a well-known 
politician 
from the late 19th century. 
I wonder why it's there. 
Do you know what his con_nection 
was with this area? 
TRUDIE: No idea. Let's add it to our list of things 
to find out. Oh., I've just thought 
-you know Q29
people might ask in the iibrary 
about local organisations, 
lik� sports clubs? Well. I 
wonder if they keep a database, 
or whether 
they just look online. 
I quite fancy finding 
out what the differences 
are between a library 
that's Q30
open to the public 
and one that's 
part of a museum, for example -they must be 
very different. 
TRUDIE: Mmm. Then something 
else I'd like to know is ... 

STEWART: Right. 

Q28

SECTION 4 

In public 
discussion 
of business, 
we take certain 
values for granted. 
Today I'm going to talk 
about four of them: collaboration, 
hard work, creativity 
and excellence. 
Most people would 
say they're 
all 'good things'. 
I'm going to suggest 
that's 
an over-simple 
view. 

The trouble with these 
values is that they're 
theoretical 
concepts, 
removed from the reality 
of 
day-to-day 
business. 
Pursue values by all means. but be prepared 
for what may happen as a Q31
result. 
They can actually 
cause damage, which is not at all the intention. 

Business 
leaders 
generally 
try to do the right thing. 
But all too often the right thing backfires, 
if those leaders 
adopt values without 
understanding and 
managing 
the side effects 
that arise. 
The values can easily 
get in the way of what's actually 
intended. 

Q32 

OK. So the first 
value I'm going to discuss 
is collaboration. 
Er, let me give you an example. 
On a management 
training 
course I once attended, 
we were put into groups and had to Q33 
construct 
a bridge across a stream, 
using building 
blocks that we were given. 
The rule was 
that everyone 
in the team had to move at least one building 
block during the construction. 
This was intended 
to encourage 
teamwork. 

98 

Test5 

But it was really 
a job best done by one person. 
The other teams tried to collaborate 
building 
the structure, 
and descended 
into confusion, 
with everyone 
getting 
in each other's 
way. Our team leader 
solved the challenge 
brilliantly. 
She simply asked everyone 
in the team 
to move a piece a few centimetres, 
to comply with the rule, and 
then let the person in the 
team with an aptitude 
for puzzles 
like this build it alone. 
We finished 
before any other team. 
My point is that the task wasn't 
really 
suited 
to teamworking, 
so why make it one? 

on Q34 

Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency 
- a common cause of poor sales. 
In the case of Q35 
a smartphone 
that a certain 
company launched, 
one director 
wanted to target 
the business 
market. and another demanded 
it was aimed at consumers. 
The company wanted both 
directors 
to be involved, 
so gave the product 
a consumer-friendly 
name. but marketed 
it to 
companies. 
The result was 
that it met the needs of neither 
group. It would have been better 
to let one director 
or the other have his way, not both. 

Now industriousness, 
or hard work. It's easy to mock people who say they 
work hard: after 
all, a hamster 
running around 
in a wheel is working 
hard -and getting nowhere. 
Of course 
hard work is valuable, 
but only when properly 
targeted. 
Otherwise 
it wastes the resources Q36 
that companies 
value most -time and energy. 
And that's 
bad for the organisation. 
There's 
a management 
model that groups people according 
to four criteria: 
clever, hard-
working, 
stupid 
and lazy. Here 'lazy' 
means having a rational 
determination 
not to carry out Q37 
unnecessary 
tasks. 
It doesn't 
mean trying to 
avoid work altogether. 
Most people display 
two 
of these characteristics, 
and the most 
valuable 
people are those who 
are both clever 
and 
lazy: they possess 
intellectual 
clarity, 
anq they don't rush into 
making decisions. 
They come 
up with solutions 
to save the time and 
energy spentby 
the stupid 
and hard-working 
group. 
Instead 
of throwing 
more man-hours 
at a problem, 
the clever and lazy group looks for a more 
effective 
solution. 
Next we come to creativity. 
This often 
works well -creating 
an attention-grabbing 
TV 
commercial, 
for example, 
might lead to increased 
sales. 
But it isn't 
always a good thing. 
Some advertising 
campaigns 
are remembered 
for their creativity, 
without having 
any effect 
on sales. 
This happened 
a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate 
bar: subsequent Q38 
research 
showed that plenty 
of consumers remembered 
the adverts. 
but had no idea what 
was being advertised. 
The trouble 
is that the creator 
derives 
pleasure 
from coming up with 
the idea, and wrongly 
assumes the audience 
for the campaign 
will share that feeling. 

A company that brings 
out thousands 
of new products 
may seem more creative 
than a 
company that only has a few, but it may be 
creative, 
and make smaller 
profits. 
Creativity 
needs to be targeted. 
to solve a problem 
that the company has identified. 
Just coming up with 
more and more novel products 
isn't necessarily 
a good thing.

but __ 
it takes a long time to achieve

In business, 
being first with a product

profitable 
than having the best 
product.

The study found that the Q40
pioneers 
commanded 
an average 
market share of 29 percent. 
while the followers 
achieved 
less than half that. only 13 percent 
-even though 
their product 
might have been better. 

Insisting 
on excellence 
in everything 
we do is time-consuming, 
wastes energy and leads 
to losing 
out on opportunities. 
Sometimes, 
second-rate 
work is more worthwhile 
than 
excellence. 
'Make sure it's excellent' 
sounds like a good approach 
to business, 
but the 'just­

approach 
is likely 
to be more successful.

That's right, the festival begins on the 16 th of May and goes on till the 19 th
WOMAN: Oh, that's great. I'll be there from the 15 th till the 19 th
. So could you tell me the 
programme, please? 
Well, on the first day, there's the opening ceremony, in the town centre. People start 
gathering around 2 o'clock, to get a good place to see from, and the events will start 01
at 2.45, and finish about 5.30. 
WOMAN: OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there early to get a good spot. 
The festival will be officially opened by the mayor. He'll just speak for a few minutes, 
welcoming everyone to the festival. All the town councillors will be there, and of 
course lots of other people.

of her? 
I certainly have. She was a scientist years ago. 
That's right. She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago, so we're celebrating 
her centenary. 
I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her. I didn't realise she came from 
Kenton. 
Yes. Well, all that will take place in the afternoon, and later. as the sun sets. there'll Q5 
be a firework display. You should go to the park to watch. as you'll get the best view

between children and their grandparents. 
WOMAN: That sounds interesting. It makes a change from children and parents, doesn't it! 
Exactly. Because the art college is in use for classes, throughout the festival, the

Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I'll bring you up to date 
with what I know. 
As you know, we're flying firstto. Munich, on Monday the 4th .
The flight is a t 11.30, so it's too early to have lunch at the airport. I suggest we meet there for 011
coffee at 10, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home. 
When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour Q12
operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany. He's already liaised with 
the managers of the theatres we're going to visit, and he's also arranged for an officer of the 
National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay. 
Now last time we discussed this trip, I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now 
I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double 
room. I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros. but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate 
o f 110. That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this 
week. 

013 

On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of 
the theatres, but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange, so instead we'll have a 
· coach trip to one of the amazing·castles in the mountains south of Munich.

-

On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From
talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be
too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must
confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to
an Italian restaurant at home.

014 

On Wednesday afternoon. the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to Q15 
us a t the theatre. She'll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she
chose the actors, and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one. how she worked with
the playwright.

101 

Audioscripts 

Right. Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see, partly 
because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you! 

The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we're going to the 
premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don't have to dress 
formally. I gather it's rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a 
soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be 
able to attend. 

On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was 
commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist. 
We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest. 

Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it'll be in the 
garden of a palace. It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much 
protection from the wind. 

Q16 

Q17 

Q 18

On Saturday. we're going by coach to a theatre in another town. not far from Munich. This will Q19
be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will 
be attending. After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and 
there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region. 

And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday. and it's in the stunning 
setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14 th century: The performance marks the 
fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his 
first professional appearance, all those years ago. 

Q20 

And the day after that, we'll be flying back home. Now have you got any questions before I ... 

SECTION 3 

Oh good morning. You must be James. I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth. 
Thank you. 
Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies 
course, I'd like to find out something about you. Why did you decide to take this 
course? 
Wel l. my mother is Danish. and although we always lived in England, she used to 
talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit Denmark. We hardly ever 
did. though - my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or 
friends were in England they always came to see us. 
I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be 
studying. 
I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate. 
Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad. Have 
you had any thoughts about that? 
I'm really looking forward to it. And although Denmark seems the obvious place to 
go, because of my family connections, I'd love to spend the time in Iceland. 
Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged. Do you have any plans for when you graduate? A lot 
o f students go on to take a master's degree. 
I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I'm 
interested in journalism. and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing 
for magazines. I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most 
graduates do.

That'll continue next term, but the one on Scandinavian literature that's running at the 023 
moment will be replaced by more specialised courses. Oh, and by the way, if you're 
interested in watching Danish television programmes - there's going to be a course 
on that the term after next. 
JAMES: That sounds good. 
Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next 
few weeks? 
JAMES: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas. 
Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be 
difficult to get hold of the books you'll need. Why not leave that for another time? 
JAMES: Right. 
You might find modern novels or 19 th century playwrights interesting. 
I've read o r seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea. 
Fine. I'll put you down for that topic. 
JAMES: Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper? 
First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail. That 
approach certainly has its place, but I think you first need to get an understanding 
of the literature in the context of the society in which i t was produced - who it was 
written for, how it was published, and so on. I also think that's more fruitful than 
placing it within the history of the genre.

Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the

Of course. Have you decided yet what to write about? 
No, I haven't. There's so much that seems interesting - Viking settlement in other 
countries, trade, mythology ... 
Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which 
is kept in the library. It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find i t helpful. I'll 
give you the details in a moment. Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be 
very difficult to choose just one. 
OK. I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year. 
Should I watch that again? 
If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it - it's more fantasy than reality. 
But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch. It makes some 
interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic. 
Right·· --
So then should I work out an outline? 
Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage. And then you should start 
looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise 
according to those headings. 
I see. 
Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading. Make 
sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper 
in full. 
OK. Thanks, that's very helpful.

SECTION 4 

Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably. After all, there was a 
time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions. Conditions have 
improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common. And human resources managers 
nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary. 

What is conflict in the workplace? Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range 
of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to - at the 
opposite extreme - physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying, by which 
I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a 
weaker position. Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be 
described in these terms. 

Q31 

As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it. But often it's caused by 
someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else, in order to feel that 
they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people. 

Q32 

In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the personality o f one Q33 
is in some way incompatible with that of the other person. A general habit of optimism in one 
person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic - not that that 
justifies treating them badly, of course. 

Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their 
team than in the company as a whole. These conflicts are called 'structural', and could come 
about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who 
do any useful work, and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators. 

Q34 

Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned - the situation is likely to be very stressful Q35 
for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months. For the company, if no 
effort is made to deal with conflict, it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown 
of the business. 

Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs - has uncovered some of the reasons 
why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics: 
confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable o f great achievements - with a high level 
o f anxiety, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves o r by the directors of the 
company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their 
decisions. 

In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic. And it's 
particularly difficult to tackle the situation where colleagues, managers and board members 
are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can't agree on strategic issues and on 
where they see the business going. there are real problems. 

Q36 

Q37 

For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an autocratic form 
of management - where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -
would see more conflict than others. Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic Q38 
business model. can suffer 
when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting 
demands. 

more. 

Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects. Of course 
the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place. A good manager, at any level. will make 
efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with, particularly those who report to them. 
That will involve politeness in all communications, and treating them as equals who happen 
to have a different role within the organisation. 

Q39 

104 

Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand. In such cases the human 
resources department often gets involved. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees 
human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive, then an external mediator 
might be able to help. By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been 
happening, they can build a clear picture of the situation, and give feedback that both sides 
will accept, precisely because they're independent.

Hello? 
Hi, Susie, it's Paul here. How are you? Enjoying your new job? You're working at

Yes. I started when the library re-opened a month ago . It's great. 
Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while. 
sus1E: Oh, you should. It doesn't cost anything, and the new library has all sorts of 
facilities. It's not Just a place where you borrow books. For instance, there's an 
area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have 
there. Some people spend the whole morning there. 
Mmm. Wish I had that amount of time to spend! 
Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and eve rything? 
We are, yes. But we're hoping to get away this summer . We're thinking of going to 
Greece.

OK. Now Carol's organising a project for the history class she teaches at school -
it's about life in the town a hundred years ago. Do you have anything that might be 
useful? 
Yes, actually we've now got a new section with materials on the history of the town 02

Right. I'll tell her. You can't always find that sort of thing on the internet. Now in the

They might be interested , yes . 
And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge . That doesn 't 
begin until after the end of term . They have to read six book s , and they get a 
certificate if they manage it. 
So that gives them something to do while they 're on holiday , instead of getting 
bored . 
That's the idea. And there's sp ecial activities for adults too . On Friday we have a 
local author called Tanya Streep who 's going to be talking about her new novel. 
It's called 'Catch the Mouse ' and she based the story on a crim e that actually too k

appointment or anything, they just turn up. 
Well , my mother might be interested, I'll let her know. 
OK . And there 's another service which you wouldn 't expect from a library, which is QB 
a free medical check-up. The hospital arranges for someone to come along and

Q10 

SECTION 2 

In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays 
we offer at BC Travel. Now, the travel business is very competitive and it's important to be 
aware of how the market's changing and developing. In terms of age groups, the over -65s are 
an important market, and one that's increasing steadily year on year. The fewest holidays are 
taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds , and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at 
present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group's also seen the biggest drop 
over the last few years, whereas there 's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken 
by the 55 to 64-year-olds. As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned , bookings there are 
steady, but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected. 

Q11 & 
Q12 

Q11 & 
Q12 

One trend we 're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays 
in which clients do some kind of spec ialised activity. I'm not talking here about adventure 
holidays , where clients take part in high - risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill 
of it. Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music. 
They 're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite , in fact. But they 
do often take place outside the main tourist centres. which gives an opportunity for clients 
to find out more about the local people and customs, and many say this is one of the most 
positive features of these holidays . Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or 

Q13 & 
Q14 

106 

Test 7 

talent, but clients often say that more than this. it's the chance to create lasting relationships 
with other like-minded people that's the main draw. 

013 & 
014 

Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays. Our painting holidays take 
place in four different centres in France and Italy and they're very popular with clients of all 
abilities from beginners onwards. We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -
some of them have been with us from the start. and five addit ional ones will be joining us this 
year so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre. 

As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients 
cook recipes related to one particular country, usually the one they 're staying in. but we focus 
on dishes from a great many different ones. Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis 
on good quality, organic ingredients - that's more or less a given nowadays - and there are 
generally some meat-free recipes included. 

Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, 
and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery . Groups are small, no more 
than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday. and excursions are 
arranged with fully-trained guides . At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the 
photographs taken so that clients can see one another 's work and receive valuable feedback 
from the tutor. 

015 

016 

017 

Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays. In rrel'and and Italy we run ohe-week 
general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness .. Clients start the course with a 
consultation with a trainer, and together the y draw up an individual programme . As well as 
improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built O 18 
up in their daily lives. 

In Greece. we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their 
we ight. This has all the features you 'd expect, like a personalised diet programme, but one 
of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. People say 
it's far preferable to being in a gym. 

Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the mountain biking 
holiday. Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability. We 
offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular . 

OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so thank you very much ... 

_ NATALIE : Dave, I'm worried about our case study, rve done a bit of reading, but I'm not sure 
what's involved in actually writing a case study - I missed the lecture where Dr 
Baker talked us through it. 
OK, well it's quite straightforward . We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton 
Castle site. And you said you'd done some reading about it. 
NATALIE: Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points. 
Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? 
NATALIE: Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that. 
OK , so we can compare what we've read . Then we have to decide on a particular 
problem or need at our site . And then think about who we 're going to interview to get 
more information.

DAV E : 

NATALIE: OK. So who'd that be? The people who work there? And presumably some of the 
tourists too? 
Yes, both those groups. So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose . But we 
might also do some of our interviewing away from the site - we cou ld even contact 
some people here in the city. l ike administrators involved in overseein g tour ism . 
NATALIE: OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and fix times and places for 
the meetings. It's all going to take a lot of time. 
Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some 
numerical data that we can add to support our findings. 
NATALIE : And photographs? 
I think we have plenty of those already. But Dr Baker also sa id we have to establish 
with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study. or whether 
they want to be anonymous . 
NATALIE : Oh, I wouldn 't have thought of that. OK , once we 've got al l this information, 
I suppose we have to analyse it. 
Yes, put it a ll together and choose what's relevant to th e problem we 're focusing 
on, and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identi fy any tre nds or regularities 
there . That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots 
of facts. 
NATA LIE : OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next? 
DAVE: Well , then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected to make 
it as clear as possible to our readers. Things like grc;1phs, or tables, or charts ... 

DAVE: 

DAVE: 

NATALIE: Right. 
DAVE: 

Then the case study itse lf is mostly quite standard ; we begin by presenting the 
problem, and giving some background, then go through t he main sections , but th e 
thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we 'd end with some suggestions 
to deal with the problem or need we identified. but in a case study we end up with a 
question or a series of questions to our readers. and th ey decide wh at o ught to be 
done. 
NATALIE: Oh , I had n 't realised that. 

DAVE: 

NATALIE : So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Ho rton Castle 
site is why so few tourists are vi sit ing it. And we 'll find out more from our interv iews, 
but I d id find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be 
because as far as transpo rt goes, access is d ifficu lt. 
I read that too , but th at report wa s ac tually writt e n ten yea rs ago, wh en th e road 
there was rea lly bad, but that's been improved now. And I th ink there's plenty of 
fascinating stuff there for a rea lly good day out. but you 'd never rea lise it from the 
castl e website - maybe that's the problem . 
NATALIE : Yes, it's rea lly dry and boring. 
I read somewh e re a suggest ion that wh at the castle needs is a visitor ce ntre. So w e 
could have a look for some inform ation abo ut that on the internet. What would we 
need to know? 
NATALI E: Well , who 'd use it for a start . It'd be good to know wh at categor ies the visitors fell 
into too, like school pa rties o r retired people, but I think we'd have to ta lk to staff to 
get that inform ation . 
OK . And as we're thinking of suggesting a v is itor ce ntre w e'd also have to look at 
potential problems . I mean, obvious ly it wouldn't be cheap to set up. 
NATALI E: No , but it cou ld be a really good investment. And as it's on a histor ica l site it'd need 
to get spec ia l planning permission. I expect. Th at might be hard .

Right , especially as the only possible place for it would be at t he entrance , and th at's 
right in front of the castle. 

NATALIE : Mmm . 
DAVE: 

But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton. At present it's a bit of a ghos t 
town. Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifi cations, the young people 
all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the only people left are 
children and those who 've retired. 
NATALIE : Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that 
tourists m ight cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact. At present 
the tourists can just wander round wherever they want, but if numbers increase , 
there might have to be some restrictions, l ike stic k ing to marked ways. And the re 'd 
need to be guides and wa rdens around to make sure these were enforced. 
Yes, we could look at that too. OK , well .. . 

DAV E: 

Test 7 

029

SECTION 4 

OK , so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife . 
Now I'll discuss a particular examp le. Let's take a look at me rcury. Mercury 's one of the 120 or 
so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbo l Hg. It's a shiny , s ilvery subs tance . 
You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it's not used much for domestic 
purposes now because it's highly tox ic . 

But the problem is that the arnount of merc u ry in the environme nt's increas ing. Th e main 
reaso n fo r t his is the power plants used to prod uce e lect ricity . T he ma in so urce of energy tha t 
m ost of t hem use is st ill coal, and w hen it's burned it releases mercu ry into t he atm os phere. 
Some of this gets deposi ted into lakes and rivers, and if it's ingested by a fish it's not 
ex c rete d , it sta ys in the fis h's body a nd it enters t he food ch ai n . So it's bee n known for some 
time th at b irds w hic h eat fish may be affected, but w hat wa s n't know n until quite recent ly is 
that those that eat insects can also be affected . 

So a woman called C laire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting 
birds . 

And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by merc ury poison ing , she 's 
looking for more subtle sub-effects . And these may be to do w ith the behaviou r of the birds, 
or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems 
with memory, for examp le . And she 's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on 
bird song. Now . the process of song learning happens at a part icular stage in the birds' 
development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by 
·listening to the songs produced by ' its ·father,-rather than by ,any othe r bird. ··· · 

031 

032 

033 

And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male b irds are expose d to 034 
. mercury, if they"eat food contam inate·d with inercuiy, ·then . the so ngs fh-ey-produce -a ren'fEis· -· 
complex as those prod uced by other birds . So quite low-leve l exposure to mercury is l ike ly 
to have an impact on male birds in a nat ural situation , because it can mean that they 're less 
attract ive to female birds , and so it can affect their chances of reproduct ion . 

03 5 

Now the way she's carryi ng out this research is worth thinking about. She 's using a mixt ure 
of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carr ied out outdoo rs in the wild. T he 
lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a 
natural setting, so the experimenter has a much higher level of control, and that means they 
can be more confident about their results in some ways . And of course they don 't have to 
worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them . 

036 

109 

Audioscripts 

So what are the implications here for humans? Well , because many birds are migratory, they Q37 
may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites . For example, it's been found that 
ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters ove r a thousand 
kilometres away, and presumably eaten. But these birds likely had mercury levels high 
enough to warrant concern for human consumption. 

In addit ion, going back to song learning by birds , we saw that this may be affected by 
mercury contamination. Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental 
delays in the acquisition of language, and in fact this process is very similar in the brain 
regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But mercury contamination has 
other important implications for humans as well. It's now known that an unborn child can be 
affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury, and these effects can 
be quite substantial. 

In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing 
or environmental wellbeing. It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from 
power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for 
everyone . Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wild life. But as we 've seen , the 
issues go beyond that , and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully .

Yes , I am. Could I have your name , please? 
It's Margaret Smith. 
Are you looking for a permanent job, Margaret? 
No, temporary. I've got a permanent job starting in a few months ' time, and I 
want to do something else until then. 
What work do you do? 
This will probably sound crazy - I used to be a lawyer, and then I made a 
complete career change and I'm going to be a doctor . I've just finished my 
tra ining. 
Right. And have you had any experience of leading cycle tr ips? 
Yes, I've led several bike tours in Africa. The trip to India that I had arranged to 
lead next month has now been cancelled, so when I saw you were advert ising 
for tour leaders , I decided to apply . 
OK. Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size 
of the group. Some tours are for very experienced cyclists , but we've got a tour 
coming up soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional 
leader . It's a cycling holiday for families . Would that suit you? 
It certainly would. I enjoy working with children, and I probably need some more 
experience before I go on a really challenging trip. 
That tour includes several teenagers : have you worked with that age group 
before? 
Yes, I'm a volunteer worker in a youth club, where I help people to improve their 
cycling skills . Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.

W~Jc_ome ta. this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city, 
As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep , 
but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing , vibrant area of the city, which is also home to 
one of the city 's fastest-growing communities. The nearby university has always meant the 
area's popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates 
embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments 
recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live . 

The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures. jewellery and 
ceramics which won't break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables . 
There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all

over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the 
city 's first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today . 

The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there's a policy of encouraging new young 
designers. The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate 
about fashion. This year they 've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from th e 
music and technology that's part of their everyday l ife, using both natural and man-made 
fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers, and the 
winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening. 

Q13 

Parking at the Sheepmarket 
is easy. There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces 
on the roadsides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want 
to spend the day there it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It's not 
expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores. you 'll not be charged Q14 
at all. After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very 
reasonable. 

The Sheepmarket 
is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country. 
If you look at our map, you ' ll see some of the main attractions there . Most visitors start from 
Crawley Road , at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in Q15 
the city. and is open to the public. It's on the north side of Crawley Road. next to the footpath 
that leads to the public gardens. 

The area 's particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures . The Thumb' is1ust what ~ts name Q16 
suggests. but it's about 10 metres high . You'll see it on Hill Road. across the road froni the 
Bank . 

The Museum 's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes. It's on the east 
side of the Sheepmarket. on City Road. It's on the other side of the road from the pub lic 
gardens. immediately facing the junction with Hill Road. 

Q17 

The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off St ation Square. not far fr om the Q18 
public gardens. The road ends at th e gallery - it doesn't go anywhere else. That's open eve ry 
day except Mondays . 

The W a rner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art. It's on City Ro ad . near the junction with 
Crawley Road. on th e same side of the road as th e public gardens. It's op e n on w ee kdays 
from 9 to 5 , and entry is free . 

Q19 

Finally. if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork. the place to go is Nucleus . You Q2O 
ne ed to go from Cr awley Road up through Sta tion Square and east along Hill Road until you 
get to a small winding road turning off . Go up there and it's on your right - if you get to City 
Road you've gone too far.

KAT IE: Joe, you know I'm giving a presentation in our film studies class next w eek? 
Yes. 
KATI E: Well, cou ld we d iscuss it? I could do with gett ing someon e else's opinion. 
J OE: Of course. Ka tie. Wh at a re you going to t a lk a bout ? 
It's about film adap t ations of S hak espea re 's plays. I've got v e ry int erested in a ll th e 
diff e rent approac hes that film dir ec t ors take . 
J OE : Uhuh . 

KATI E :

Test8 

JOE: 

KATIE: So I thought I'd start with Giannetti, who's a professor of film and literature, and in one 021 
of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations based 
on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels . 
Right. 
I've already made some notes on that, so I just need to sort those out before the 
presentation. I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the worst examples 
of Shakespeare adaptations that they've seen, and to say why. That should be more 
fun than having their favourite versions. 
Yes, I ca n certainly think of a couple! 
KATIE: Right. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow . I came across something on the 
internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film 
clips to illustrate her ideas. 
JOE: Will you have enough time , though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? 
After all , I doubt if you'll be able to find all the cl ips you want. 
KATIE: Hmm. Perhaps you're right. OK, well, I'd better do some slides instead, saying how 
various films relate to what she says. That should encourage discussion. 
JOE : Mmm . 
KATIE : Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because 024 
they're concerned with issues of the time when the film is made. 
You mean things like patriotism, or the role of governments? 
KATIE: Exactly. It's quite tricky, but I've got a few ideas I'd like to discuss.

---------------------------------------------·---·---·--------- . ---~---------------------------------. --------------------------, -------------------------

JOE : 

KATIE : And finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of 
approac hes , and make some comments on them . Do you know the Japanes e filni 
Ran? 
I haven' t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare 's King Lear , wasn 't it? 
KATIE: That's right. It was a very loose adaptat ion. using the same situation and sto ry, but 
moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain. So for example t he 
king 's daughters become sons, because in Japanese cu lture at that time, women 
couldn't succeed to the throne. 
JOE: OK. I hope you're going to talk about the1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think 
that's one of the best Shakespeare films . It really brings the play to life , doesn't it? 
KATIE: Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what 
life was like at the time of the play. 
JOE : Absolutely . Right, what's next? 
KATIE: Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet , the 1996 film, which moves the action into the 
present day. 
JOE : Yes, it worked really well , I thought - changing the two feuding families in the original 
to two competing business empires, even though they're speaking in the English of the 
original play. 
KATIE : YoLJ'd ~xp~ct it would sound really b_izarre, but I found I soon got used to it. . 
JOE: Me too. 
KATIE : Then I thought I'd include a real Hollywood film , one that's intended to appeal to a 
mass commercial audience. 
There must be quite a number of those. 
KATIE: Yes, but I've picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but 
it's more like a typical action hero movie - there are loads of special effects, but no 
unifying interpretation of the play. 
JO E : All show and no substance. 
KATIE: Exactly. Then there's Prospero 's Books, based on The Tempest. That was really 
innovative, from a stylistic point of view .

JOE: 

JOE : Didn 't it include dance and singing and anima t ion, as well as live ac tors? 
KATIE: Yes. it did. I also want to mention Looking for Richard . Did you ever see it? 
No. but I've read about it. It was a blend of a documen tary with a few scenes from 
Richard Ill, wasn 't it? 
KATIE : That's right. It's more a way of looking into how people nowadays conne ct wi th the 
playwright - the play is really just th e starting point. And tha t' l l be where I finish . 
JOE : Well , it sounds as though it'll be very interesting .

SECTION 4 

This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, t he study of sound , in relation to urban 
environments such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself , I think this is an area where 
we're likely to see great changes . In the past , researching urban sounds capes was simple . 
We measured levels of sound in decibels , so I used to take my sound meter and I measured 
the noise somewhere , and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sou nd 
became annoying . 

With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up wha t we call no ise maps , 
maps of the sound environment. But actually these aren't a lot of use . What the y do show is 
that the highest noise levels are generally on roads - well, that's not really ver y surpr ising . 
But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don 't show , because they can 't captur e 
the complex way that sound varies over time . So they ignore important issues such as the 
noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours , and th is 
sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don't have any databases on this sort 
of information . As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact 
that people vary in their perceptions of no ise - so someone like me with years of wor k ing in 
acoust ics might be very different from you in that regard . 

0 3 1 

But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude, they 've been usefu l in providi ng 
information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it's a 
political matter. And that's important - we need rules and regulations because noise can 
cause all sorts of problems. 

0 32 

Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so c ity-dwe llers 
often suffer from interrupted sleep . It's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of 
stress , due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood. A nd there 
are other problems as well, for instance if schoolchildren don 't have a qu iet place to study . 
their work will suffer. 

Now , one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn 't differentiate between different 
types of noise. Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and 
relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels - think of the sound made by a fountain 
in a town square, for example . That's not necessarily something that we 'd want to contro l o r 
reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design . This is 
going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn 't going to help us here . Instead, 
many researchers are using social science techniques, studying people 's emotional response 
to sound by using questionnaires and so on. 

03 3 

0 34 

035 

So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent 
interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradi ctory - Q._ 036 
city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of 
high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee mach ine, but these mustn 't be too intrusive. 
because at the same time we need to be able to relax. 

114 

One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to 
use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very 
little training in this area. But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add 
to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they tend to see it as something to be 
avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that's just a job for engineers like the 
street drainage system. 

TestB 

037 

What's needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something 
that has the qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to 
know what governs it and how designers can work with it. We need to develop a complex 
understanding of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? What 
can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with 
human development and social relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and 
feelings? Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself? 

Today's powerful technologies can also help us . To show us their ideas and help us to 
imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual 
reality- but these programs are silent. In the future such programs could use realistic 
sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using 
the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the 
ears as well as the eyes.

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate covers the key features and rounds off the description with an 
overview. Organisation is evident, however not wholly logical, and it is sometimes 
difficult to relate data to specific age groups. Vocabulary is just about adequate, 
but is rather dependent on input material [regular physical activity I percentage]: 
original material is limited to e.g. [teenager I mid-twenties] with a lot of inaccuracy 
in word formation. Most sentence forms consist of simple structures and these 
are often inaccurate [bars's changed and interesting I men's percentage are 
increasing I the percentage more decrease unti�, though there is some accuracy in 
comparative forms [is higher than].

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate addresses all parts of the prompt, although there is some 
misunderstanding of the term shared freely. Ideas relating to each sector 
mentioned in the prompt are presented, yet there is not much development of 
these, especially of sharing ideas in the business world. There is a clear overall 
progression, with the candidate's own opinion presented at the end, but there 
are some errors in the use of cohesive devices [working there on out of this I 
which scientist]. Lexis is mainly appropriate for the task, though there are some 
errors in word choice [actual I releases] and spelling [govenment I limite I 
theme I loose]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, with a fair 
degree of accuracy: errors in grammatical control seldom prevent meaning from 
coming through.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The response looks at some advantages and disadvantages of the topic, but 
does not reach any conclusion. As a result, there is a lack of overall progression, 
although organisation is evident and cohesive devices are used (though rather 
mechanically) [One of advantages I For example I A/so I Another disadvantage I 
For instance]. The range of lexis is adequate for the task, however there are often 
spelling mistakes [contries I yonge I quilifiedj and errors in word choice or formation 
[chancing to improve I unemployee problem]. There are attempts to produce 
complex sentence forms, but there is a lack of grammatical control which can 
cause some difficulty for the reader [ ... due to some countries limit the population, if 
that have more young children it will over limit].

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate organises the information well and describes the trends in the 
various groups, but the lack of data to support the descriptions is a significant 
omission. There is a clear progression throughout the response, with good 
management of cohesive devices [percentage of people who I during the same 
period I in these segments o f the chart I the groups in which I such facilities]. Lexis 
shows some flexibility and precision [on a weekly basis] and there is evidence of 
less common items [segments I major changes I most of the population I most/ 
least popular I with the exception 
with few errors in word choice [visualises I be 
I clients]. There is a variety of complex structures used with flexibility and accuracy, 
but there are also a few errors in grammatical control and in punctuation.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 7.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is a good response which would achieve an even higher score if there was 
more focus on large sums of money and on between cities. The writing is well 
organised and there is a clear progression throughout, although the use of some 
cohesive devices could be more flexible. There is a wide range of vocabulary, 
used appropriately and naturally, [preferred method of transporlation I leave the 
driving to the professional I more affordable I ever-expanding urban populations I 
embrace the idea of], but some spelling errors are noted [Communters I whi// I cheif 
I ammount I busses]. There is a wide range of structures and again, these are used 
flexibly, however there are occasional errors in punctuation.

TEST 8, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate has provided a clear introduction and an overview of the key 
stages of the process. Each stage is identified and described, although there are 
some minor errors in the reporting of stage 5. There is room for expansion of the 
description of each stage, which could help to achieve a higher score. There is a 
clear overall progression, with each stage being signalled by appropriate markers 
[First I in order to I After that I At this point I Then, the final step I Finally]. These 
markers are adequate, but a higher score might be achieved by varying their 
position in each sentence, rather than always placing them at the beginning. The 
range of vocabulary is adequate for the task and there are attempts to use more 
variety here [five general steps I connected I accumulated], though there are 
some examples of error in word choice .[box I tank I a circle movements I a circular 
movement], in spelling [undergrownd I trough I conteiner I sumary] and in word 
formation [condensered I condensed I gas I gaseous I :trasladated I transferred? I 
condensering I condensing]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, 
including accurate use of passive forms. There are some errors [a/ an I who I 
what], but otherwise the level of accuracy is good. The same level of accuracy, over

Sample answers for Writing tasks 

TEST 8, WRITING TASK 2 

' 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is an attempt to address the prompt and some main ideas are put forward, 
but there is no discussion of is likely to result in a society of individuals who 
only think about their own wishes. This omission, and the fact that the response 
is underlength, limit the Band score rating. Organisation is evident, however the 
answer lacks contextualisation, and cohesion within sentences is sometimes 
faulty [that is cause many African children to ... I they will show respect to their 
ad community in is genera�. Vocabulary is the strongest aspect of the response 
[confident I make mistakes I dictate I the right path I do something wrong I manage 
their affairs I vandals and aggressors I determine their own choices I show respect 
I oppressed I respect children I justify] and although spelling errors occur, they do 
not generally prevent meaning from coming through [becouse I fought I smagging]. 
Grammatical control is variabl.e: some complex structures are produced accurately 
while other, simpler, forms contain errors. Punctuation and capitalisation are also 
sometimes faulty.

Introduction

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is widely recognised as 
a reliable means of assessing the language ability of candidates who need to study 
or work where English is the language of communication. These Practice Tests are 
designed to give future IELTS candidates an idea of whether their English is at the 
required level.
IELTS is owned by three partners, Cambridge English Language Assessment, part of 
the University of Cambridge, the British Council and IDP Education Pty Limited (through 
its subsidiary company, IELTS Australia Pty Limited). Further information on IELTS can 
be found on the IELTS website www.ielts.org.

WHAT IS THE TEST FORMAT?

IELTS consists of four components. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking 
tests. There is a choice of Reading and Writing tests according to whether a candidate is 
taking the Academic or General Training module.

Academic
For candidates wishing to study at 
undergraduate or postgraduate levels, 
and for those seeking professional 
registration.

General Training
For candidates wishing to migrate to an 
English-speaking country (Australia, Canada, 
New Zealand, UK), and for those wishing to 
train or study at below degree level.

The test components are taken in the following order:

Listening
4 sections, 40 items, approximately 30 minutes

Introduction 

HOW IS IELTS SCORED? 

IELTS results are reported on a nine-band scale. In addition to the score for ove rall language 
ability, IELTS provides a score in the form of a profile for each of the four skills (Listening, 
Reading , Writing and Speaking). These scores are also reported on a nine-band scale. Al l 
scores are recorded on the Test Report Form along with details of the candidate's nationality , 
first language and date of birth. Each Overall Band Score corresponds to a descriptive 
statement which gives a summary of the English language ability of a candidate classified at 
that level. The nine bands and their descriptive statements are as follows : 

9 Expert User - Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate , accurate and 
fluent with complete understanding. 

8 Very Good User - Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional 
unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in 
unfamiliar situations . Handles complex detailed argumentation well. 

7 Good User - Has operational command of the language, though with occasional 
inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally 
handles complex language weJI and understands detailed reasoning . 

6 Competen t User - Has generally effective command of the language despit e some 
inaccu racies, inapprop riacies and misunder s tandings. Can use and unde rs tand fairly 
compl ex language , part ic ula rly in famili ar si tuat ions. 

5 Modest User - Has partial command of the language , coping with overall meaning in 
most situations , though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic 
communicat ion in own field. 

4 Limited User - Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems 
in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language. 

3 Extremely Limited User - Conveys and understands only general meaning in very 
familiar situations. Frequen t breakdowns in communication occur. 

2 Intermittent User - No real communication is possible except for the most basic 
information using isol ated words .or short formulae in familiar situations and to meJ~t 
immediate needs . Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English . 

1 Non User - Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated 
words. 

0 Did not attempt the test- No assessable inform a tion p rovid ed.

Introduction 

MARKING THE PRACTICE TESTS 

Listening and Reading 

The Answer Keys are on pages 116-123 . 
Each question in the Listening and Reading tests is worth one mark . 

Questions which require letter I Roman numeral answers 

• For questions where the answers are letters or Roman numerals, you should write only 
the number of answers required. For example, if the answer is a single letter or numeral 
you should write only one answer. If you have written more letters or numerals than are 
required, the answer must be marked wrong. 

Questions which require answers in the form of words or numbers 

• Answers may be written in upper or lower case . 
• Words in brackets are optional - they are correct, but not necessary . 
• Alternative answers are separated by a slash (/). 
• 
If you are asked to write an answer using a certain number of words and/or (a) 
number(s), you will be penalised if you exceed this. For example, if a question specifies 
an answer using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS and the correct answer is 'black 
leather coat', the answer 'coat of black leather ' is incorrect. 
In questions where you are expected to complete a gap, you should only transfer the 
necessary missing word(s) onto the answer sheet. For example, to complete 'in the ... ', 
where the correct answer is 'morning', the answer 'in the morning' would be incorrect. 
• All answers require correct spelling (including words in brackets) . 
• Both US and UK spelling are acceptable and are included in the Answer Key. 
• All standard alternatives for numbers, dates and currencies are acceptable. 
• All standard abbreviations are acceptable. 
• You will find additional notes about individual answers in the Answer Key . 

• 

Writing 

The sample answers are on pages 124-131. It is not possible for you to give yourself a mark 
for the Writing tasks. We have provided sample answers (written by candidates), showing 
their score and the examiner's comments. These sample answers will give you an insight 
into what is required for the Writing test.

Introduction 

HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES? 

At the end of each Listening and Reading Answer Key you will find a chart which will help 
you assess whether, on the basis of your Practice Test results, you are ready to take the 
IELTS test. 
In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind. Your 
performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band Score 
from 1 to 9 for each of the components and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which 
is the average of your scores in the four components . However, institutions considering 
your application are advised to look at both the Overall Band Score and the Bands for 
each component in order to determine whether you have the language skills needed for a 
particular course of study. For example, if your course involves a lot of reading and writing, 
but no lectures, listening skills might be less important and a score of 5 in Listening might be 
acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a course which has lots of lectures 
and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening might be unacceptable even though the 
Overall Band Score was 7 . 
Once you have marked your tests, you should have some idea of whether your listening 
and reading skills are good enough for you to try the IELTS test. If you did well enough in 
. one component, but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are ready 
to take the test. 
The Practice Tests have been checked to ensure that they are of approximately the same 
level of difficulty as the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the 
Practice Tests will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you 
an idea of your poss ible future performance and it is u ltimately up to you to make decisions 
based on your score. 
Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have 
based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept. 
The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score than 
most other institutions.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13 , which are based on Reading 
Passage 1 below. 

Cork 

Cork - the thick bark of the cork oak 
tree (Quercus suber) - is a remarkable 
material. It is tough, elastic, buoyant , 
and fire-resistant, and su itab le for a 
wide range of purposes. It has a lso 
been us ed for millen ni a: th e anci ent 
Egyptians sealed their sa rcopha gi 
(stone coffins) with cork, while the 
ancient Greeks and Romans used it 
for anything from beehives to sandals. 

And the cork oak itself is an 
extraordinary tree. Its bark grows 
up to 20 cm in thickness, insulating 
the tree like a coat wrapped around 
the tr unk and br anches and keeping 
th e inside at a constant 20°C all year 
round. Developed most probably as 
a defence against forest fires, th e 
bark of the cork oak has a particular 
cellular structure - with about 
40 million cells per cubic centimetre -
that technology has nev er succeeded 
in re plicatin g . Th e cells are filled with 
air, which is why cork is so buoyant. 
It also has an elasticity that means 
you can squash it and watch it spring 
back to its original size and shape 
when you release the pressure. 

Cork oaks grow in a number of 
Mediterranean countries, including 

Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and 
Morocco. They flourish in warm, sunny 
climates wher e there is a minimum of 
400 millimetres of rain per year, and 
not more than 800 millimetres. Like 
grape vines, th e tre es thrive in poor 
soil, putting down deep roots in search 
of moisture and nutrients. Southern 
Portugal's Alen tejo region m eet s all of 
these requirements, wh ich explains 
why, by the early 20th century, this 
region had become the wor ld 's largest 
producer of cork, and why today it 
accounts for roughly half of all cork 
production around the world. 

Most cork forests are famil y-owned. 
Many of these family businesses , and 
ind eed many of the trees the1nsel ve s, 
are around 200 years old. Cork 
production is , above all, an exercise in 
patience. From the planting of a cork 
sapling to the first harvest takes 25 
years, and a gap of approximately a 
decade must separate harvests from 
an individual tree . And for top-quality 
cork, it's necessary to wait a further 
15 or 20 years . You even have to wait 
for the right kind of summer's da y to 
harvest cork. If the bark is stripped on 
a da y when it's too cold - or when the 
air is damp - the tree will be damaged .

Reading 

Cork harvesting is a very specialised 
profession. No mechanical means 
of stripping cork bark has been 
invented, so the job is done by teams 
of highly skilled workers . First, they 
make vertical cuts down the bark 
using small sharp axes, then lever · 
it away in pieces as large as they 
can manage. The most skilful cork(cid:173)
strippers prise away a semi-circular 
husk that runs the length of the trunk 
from just above ground level to the 
first branches . It is then dried on the 
ground for about four months, before 
being taken to factories, where it is 
boiled to kill any insects that might 
remain in the cork. Over 60% of 
cork then goes on to be made into 
traditional bottle stopp ers, with m ost 
of the rem a inder being used in the 
constr uction trade . Corkboard an d 
cork t iles ar e id ea l for t hermal an d 
acous t ic insul at ion, wh ile gra nul es of 
cork are us ed in th e manufacture of 
concrete . 

Recent years have seen the end of 
the virtual monopoly of cork as the 
material for bottle stoppers, due to 
concerns about the effect it may have 
on the contents of the bottle . This 

is caused by a chemical compound 
called 2,4,6 -trichloroanisole (TCA), 
which forms through the interaction 
of plant phenols, chlorine and mould . 
The tiniest concentrations - as little 
as three or four parts to a trillion -
can spoil the taste of the product 
contained in the bottle. The result 
has been a gradual yet steady move 
first towards plastic stoppers and, 
more recently , to aluminium screw 
caps. These substitutes are ch eaper to 
manufacture and, in the case of screw 
caps, more convenient for the user . 

The classic cork stopper does 
have several advantages, however. 
Firstly, its traditional image is more 
in keeping with that of the typ e of 
high qualit y goods with which it has 
long b een a ss ociat ed. Secondly -
and very impo r tan t ly - cork is a 
su stain a ble p r odu ct th at can b e 
recy cled witho ut difficulty. Mor eover, 
cor k for es t s a re a resource which 
support local biodiversity, and preven t 
desertification in the regions where 
th ey are planted. So, given the current 
concerns about environmental issues, 
the future of this ancient material 
once again looks promising.

COLLECTING 

AS A HOBBY 

C o llec ti ng m ust be one of t he most var ied

Wh y do they d o it ? 

Th e re are t h e peop le who col lect beca u se

t h at is, co ll ec t ing as a means t o an end . 
T h ey' ll look for, say, ant iques that t h ey 
can b uy cheap ly and expect to be ab le 
to se ll at a p ro fi t. But t h e re may wel l be a 
psycholog ica l e leme n t, too - buying cheap 
and se lli ng dear ca n g ive th e col lecto r a 
sense of tr iumph . And as sel l ing on l ine is so

M any co llectors co llect to dev e lop the i r 
soc ia l l ife, at tend ing m eetings o f a group 
of co llectors and exchang in g information 
on it e ms. This is a var ia nt on j oin ing a 
bridg e club o r a gym , and similar ly brings 
t h em into co nta ct w it h li ke -minded people. 

An o th er mot iv e for co l lect ing is th e d es i re 
t o find so m e thing spec ia l, or a pa rt ic u la r 
examp le of the col lec t ed item, such as a 
rare ea rly rec ord in g by a part ic ul a r s inger .

If you th ink about collect ing postage 
stamps , another po t e nt ia l reason for 
it - o r, perhaps, a resu lt of co ll ecting - is 
it s ed ucat ion a l va lue . St amp co ll ecting 
opens a w ind ow t o o th er count rie s, and 
to t he p lan t s, an imals, or famous people 
sh ow n on the i r stamps. Simi la rly, in the 
19t h ce nt u ry, many co ll ectors amassed 
foss il s, animals an d plants from around 
the g lobe, and their co ll ections provided

operations, or the technical specifications 
of different engine types. 

Similarly, people who collect dolls may go 
beyond simply enlarging their collection, 
and deve lop an interest in the way that 
dolls are made, or the materials that 
are used. These have changed over the 
centuries from the wood that was standard 
in 16th century Europe, through the wax 
and porcelain of later centur ies, to the 
plastics of today's dolls. Or collectors 
might be inspired to study how dolls 
reflect notions of what children like, or 
ought to like. 

perhaps by country in alphabet ica l order, 
or grouping stamps by what they depict(cid:173)
people, birds, maps, and so on. 

One reason, conscious or not, for what 
someone chooses to collect is to show 
the collector's ind ividualism. Someone 
who decides to collect something as 
unexpected as dog collars, for instance, 
may be conveying their belief that they 
must be interesting themselves. And 
believe it or not, there is at least one dog 
collar museum in ex istence, and it grew out 
of a personal collection. 

Not all collectors are interested in learning 
from their hobby, t ho ugh, so wha t we 
might call a psychologica l reason for 
collecting 
is the need for a sense of 
control, perhaps as a way of dealing w ith 
insecurity. Stamp collectors, for instance, 
arrange their stamps in albums, usually very 
neatly, orga ni sing their co llect ion accord in g 
to certain commonp lac e pri ncip les -

Of course, all hobbies give pleasu re, but 
the common factor in collect in g is usually 
passion: pleasure is putting 
it far too 
mi ldly. More than most other hobb ies , 
co llec ting can be totally engrossing, 
and can give a strong sense of personal 
f ulfilment. To non-collec tors it may appear 
an eccen t ric, if harmless, way of spending 
time, but potentially, col lec t ing has a lot 
going for it.

Test5 

What's the purpose of gaining knowledge? 

A 

'I would found an institution where any person can find instruction 
in a ny 
subject.' That was the found er's motto for Cornell University, and it seems an apt 
characterization of the different university, also in rhe USA, where I currently teach 
philosophy. A student can prepare for a career in resort mana gem ent, engi neerin g, 
interior design, accounting, music, law enforc ement, yo u name it. But what would 
the founders of these two in st itution s have thought of a cou rse called 'Arson for Profit'? 
I kid you not: we have it on the books. Any undergr adu ates who have met the academic 
requirements ca n s ign up for the course in our program in 'fire science'. 

B Naturally, the co urse is int end ed for pro sp ective arson in vestigator s, who can learn all 
the tricks of th e trad e for d e tect ing whether a fire was deliberately set, di scove r ing who 
did it, and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law. 
But wouldn't this also b e the perfect course for pro spec tiv e a rso ni sts to sign up for? My 
point is not to criticize academic program s in fire science: they are hi ghly welcome as 
part of the increasii1g profe ssionaliz qtion of thi s and many other occupations. However, 
it 's not unknown for a firefighter to torch a building. 1his examp le su ggests how 
dishone st and illegal behavior, with th e help of. higher ed uc a tion , ca n creep into every 
aspect of publi c and busine ss life. 

C 

I realized this anew when I was invited to spea k before a class in m arketing, which is 
a noth er of our degree pro g rams. The regular in structor is a colleague who appreciates 
th e kind of et hi cal perspective I can brin g as a phil osop h er. There a re endless ways 
I cou ld hav e approac h ed this assignm e nt, but I took my cu e from th e titl e of the 
course: 'Prin c ipl es of Marketing '. It m ade me chink co ask the st udent s, 'ls m ark et in g 
princip led?' After a ll, a subj ect matter can have principles in the sense of being codified, 
havin g rules, as with football or chess, without being principl ed in the sense of being 
e thic al. Many of the students immediately assumed chat the answer co m y question 
ab out marketin g princip les was obvious : no. Just look at th e ways in whi ch every thing 
und er the sun h as b een mark eted; obviously it n eed not be do n e in a p rin cipled 
( =et hic al) fashion . 

D 

Is chat obvious? I mad e the sugges tion, which ma y sou nd downright cra zy in light of 
t h e ev iden ce, that perhaps marketing is by d efinition principled . My in sp ir at ion for this 
judgement 
is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that an y bod y of knowledge 
co n sists of an end (or purpos e) and a means . 

24 

Reading 

E Let us apply both the terms 'means' 
and 'end' to marketing. 
The students 
have signed 
up for a course 
in order to learn how to market effectively
. But to what encP. There seem 
to be two main attitudes 
toward that question. 
One is that the answer is obvious: 
the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is to sell things 
and to make money. The other attitude 
is that the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is irrelevant: 
Each person comes to the 
program 
and course 
with 
his or her own plans, 
and these need not even concern 
the acquisition 
of marketing 
expertise 
as such. My proposal, 
which I believe 
would also be Kane's, 
is that neither 
of 
these attitudes 
captures 
the significance of 
the end to the means for marketing. 
A field 
of knowledge 
or a professional 
endeavor 
is defined 
by both the means and the end; 
hence both deserve 
scrutiny. 
Students 
need to study both how to achieve 
X, and also 
what X is. 

F It is at this point that 'Arson 
for Profit' 
becomes 
supremely 
relevant. 
That course 
is 
presumably 
all about means: how to detect 
and prosecute criminal 
activity. 
It is therefore 
that the end is good in an ethical sense. 
assumed 
When I ask fire science 
students 
to 
articulate 
the end, or purpose, 
of their field, 
they eventually 
generalize 
to something 
like, 
'The safety 
and welfare of society,' which 
seems right. 
As we have seen, someone 
could 
use the very same knowledge 
of means to achieve 
a much less noble end, such as personal 
profit 
via destructive, 
dangerouS', 
reckless activity. 
But we would not call that fire.fightin
g. 
We have a separate 
word for it: arson. 
Similarly, 
if you. employed 
the 'principles 
of 
marketing' 
in an unprincipled 
way, you would not be doing marketing. We have another 
term for it: fraud. Kant gives the example 
of a doctor 
and a poisoner, 
who use the 
identical 
knowledge 
to achieve 
their divergent 
ends. We would say that one is practicing 
medicine, 
the other, 
murder.

Passage 1 below. 

The risks agriculture 
faces in developing 
countries 

Synthesis 
of an online 
debate* 

A Two things distinguish 
food production 
from all other productive 
activities: 
first, 
every single person needs food each day and has a right to it; and second, 
it is 
hugely dependent 
on nature. 
These two unique aspects, 
one political, 
the other 
natural, 
make food production 
highly 
vulnerable 
and different 
from any other 
business. 
At the same time, cultural 
values are highly entrenched 
in food and 
agricultural 
systems worldwide. 

B Farmers everywhere 
face major risks, 
including 
extreme weather, 
long-term 
climate 
change, and price volatility 
in input and product 
markets. 
However, 
smallholder 
farmers 
in developing 
countrie
s must in addition 
deal with adverse 
environments, 
both natural, 
in terms of soil quality, 
rainfall, 
etc., and human, in 
terms of infrastructure, 
financial 
systems, markets, 
knowledge 
and technology. 
Counter-intuitively, 
hunger is prevalent 
among many smallholder 
farmers 
in the 
developing 
world. 

C Participants 
in the online debate argued that our biggest 
challenge 
is to address the 
underlying 
causes of the agricultural 
system's 
inability 
to ensure sufficient 
food for 
all, and they identified 
as drivers 
of this problem our dependency 
on fossil 
fuels and 
unsupportive 
government 
policies. 

D On the question 
of mitigating 
the risks farmers 
face, most essayists 
called for 
greater 
state interventio
n. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President 
of the 
International 
Fund for Agricultural 
Development, 
argued that governments 
can 
significantly 
reduce risks for 
farmers 
by providing 
basic services like 
roads to get 
produce more efficiently 
to markets, 
or water and food 
storage facilities 
to reduce 
losses. 
Sophia Murphy, senior advisor 
to the Institute 
for Agriculture 
and Trade 
Policy, 
suggested 
that the procurement 
and holding 
of stocks by governments 
can also help mitigate 
wild swings in food prices by alleviating 
uncertainties 
about 
market supply. 

*The personal 
names in the text refer to the authors

Reading 

E Shenggen 
Fan, Director 
General 
of the International 
Food Policy 
Research 
Institute, 
held up social 
safety 
nets and public 
welfare 
programmes 
in Ethiopia, 
Brazil 
and Mexico as valuable 
ways to address 
poverty 
among farming 
families 
and reduce their vulnerability 
to agriculture 
shocks. 
However, 
some commentators 
responded 
that cash transfers 
to poor families 
do not necessarily 
translate 
into 
increased 
food security, as these programmes 
do not always strengthen 
food 
production 
or raise incomes. 
Regarding 
state subsidies 
for agriculture, 
Rokeya 
Kabir, 
Executive 
Director 
of Bangladesh 
Nari Progati 
Sangha, 
commented 
in her 
essay that these 'have not compensated 
for the stranglehold 
exercised 
by private 
traders. 
In fact, studies 
show that sixty percent 
of beneficiaries 
of subsidies 
are not 
poor, but rich landowners 
and non-farmer 
traders.' 

F Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private 
risk management 
tools, 
like private 
insurance, 
commodity 
futures 
markets, 
and rural finance 
can help small-scale 
producers 
mitigate 
risk and allow for investment 
in improvements. 
Kabir warned 
that financial 
support 
schemes often encourage 
the adoption 
of high-input 
agricultural 
practices, 
which in the medium term may raise production 
costs 
beyond the value of their harvests. 
Murphy noted that when futures 
markets 
become excessively 
financialised 
they can contribute 
to short-term 
price volatility, 
which increases 
farmers' 
food insecurity. 
Many participants 
and commentators 
emphasised 
that greater 
transparency 
in markets 
is needed to mitigate 
the impact 
of volatil
ity, and make evident 
whether 
adequate 
stocks and supplies 
are available. 
Others contended 
that agribusiness 
companies 
should be held responsible 
for 
paying for negative 
side effects. 

G Many essayists 
mentioned 
climate 
change and its consequences 
for small-scale 
agriculture. 
Fan explained 
that 'in addition 
to reducing 
crop yields, 
climate 
change 
increases 
the magnitude 
and the frequency 
of extreme 
weather 
events, 
which 
increase 
smallholder 
vulnerabili
ty.' The growing 
unpredictability 
of weather 
patterns 
increases 
farmers' 
difficulty 
in managing 
weather-related 
risks. 
According 
to this 
author, 
one solution 
would be to develop 
crop varieties 
that are more resilient 
to new climate 
trends and extreme 
weather 
patterns. 
Accordingly, 
Pat Mooney, 
co-founder and executive 
director 
of the ETC Group, suggested 
that 'if we are to 
survive 
climate 
change, 
we must adopt policies 
that let peasants 
diversify 
the plant 
and animal species 
and varieties/breeds 
that make up our menus.' 

37 

Test 6 

H Some participating 
authors 
and commentators 
argued in favour of community­
based and autonomous 
risk management 
strategies 
through 
collective 
action 
groups, 
co-operatives 
or producers' 
groups. 
Such groups enhance market 
opportunities 
for small-scale 
producers, 
reduce marketing 
costs and synchronise 
buying and selling 
with seasonal 
price conditions. 
According 
to Murphy, 
'collective 
action 
offers 
an important 
way for farmers 
to strengthen 
their political 
and economic 
bargaining 
power, and to reduce their business 
risks.' 
One commentator, 
Giel Ton, 
warned that collective 
action 
does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort 
and money to organise, 
build trust and to experiment. 
Others, 
like Marcel Vernooij 
and Marcel Beukeboom, 
suggested 
that in order to 'apply 
what we already 
know', 
all stakeholders, 
including 
business, 
government, 
scientists 
and civil society, 
must 
work together, 
starting 
at the beginning of 
the value chain. 

Some participants 
explained 
that market price volatility 
is often worsened 
by the 
of intermediary 
purchasers 
who, taking 
advantage 
of farmers' 
vulnerability, 
presence 
dictate 
prices. 
One commentator 
suggested 
farmers 
can gain greater 
control 
over 
prices 
and minimise 
price volatility 
by selling 
directly 
to consumers. 
Similarly, 
Sonali 
Bisht, 
founder 
and advisor 
to the Institute 
of Himalayan Environmental 
Research 
and Education 
(INHERE), 
India, 
wrote that community-supported 
agriculture, 
where 
consumers 
invest 
i'n local 
farmers 
by subscription 
and guarantee 
producers 
a fair 
price, 
is a risk-sharing 
model worth more attention. 
Direct 
food distribution 
systems 
not only encourage 
small-scale 
agriculture 
but also give consumers 
more control 
over the food they consume, 
she wrote.

The Lost City 

An explorer's 
encounter 
with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, 
the most famous 
icon of the Inca civilisation 

A When the US explorer 
and academic 
Hiram Bingham arrived 
in South America 
in 
1911, he was ready for what was to be the greatest 
achievement 
of his life: 
the 
exploration 
of the remote hinterland 
to the west of Cusco, the old capital 
of the Inca 
empire in the Andes mountains 
of Peru. His goal was to locate 
the remains 
of a city 
called 
Vitcos, 
the last capital 
of the Inca civilisation. 
Cusco lies on a high plateau 
at an elevation 
of more than 3,000 metres, 
and Bingham's 
plan was to descend 
from this plateau 
along the valley 
of the Urubamba 
river, 
which takes a circuitous 
route down to the Amazon and passes through 
an area of dramatic 
canyons 
and 
mountain 
ranges. 

B When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba 
in late July, they had 
an advantage 
over travellers 
who had preceded 
them: a track had recently 
been 
blasted 
down the valley 
canyon to enable rubber to be brought 
up by mules from 
the jungle. 
Almost all previous 
traveUers 
had left the river atOllantaytambo 
and 
taken a high pass across the mountains 
'to rejoin 
the river lower down, thereby 
cutting 
a substantial 
corner, 
but also therefore 
never passing 
through 
the area 
around Machu Picchu. 

C On 24 July they were a few days into their descent 
of the valley. 
The day began 
slowly, 
with Bingham trying 
to arrange 
sufficient 
mules for the next stage of the 
trek. His companions 
showed no interest 
in accompanying 
him up the nearby hill 
to see some ruins that a local farmer, 
Melchor 
Arteaga, 
had told them about the 
night before. 
The morning 
was dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have 
been less than keen on the prospect 
of climbing 
the hill. 
In his book Lost City of the 
Incas, 
he relates 
that he made the ascent without 
having the least expectation 
that 
he would find anything 
at the top. 

D Bingham writes 
about the approach 
in vivid style in his book. First, 
as he climbs 
up the hill, 
he describes 
the evet�present 
possibility 
of deadly snakes, 
'capable 
of 
making considerable 
springs 
when in pursuit 
of their prey'; 
not that he sees any. 
Then there's 
a sense of mounting 
discovery 
as he comes -across great sweeps 
of terraces, 
then a mausoleum, 
followed 
by monumental 
staircases 
and, finally, 
the grand ceremonial 
buildings 
of Machu Picchu. 
'It seemed like an unbelievable 
dream ... the sight held me spellbound 
... ' he wrote. 

43 

Test 6 

E We should remember, 
however, 
that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight, 
not written 
until 1948, many years after his journey. 
His journal 
entries 
of the 
time reveal a much more gradual 
appreciation 
of his achievement. 
He spent 
the afternoon 
at the ruins noting down the dimensions 
of some of the buildings, 
then descended 
and rejoined 
his companions, 
to whom he seems to have said 
little 
about his discovery. 
At this stage, Bingham didn't 
realise 
the extent or the 
importance 
of the site, nor did he realise 
what use he could make of the discovery. 

F However, 
soon after returning 
it occurred 
to him that he could make a name for 
from this discovery. 
When he came to write the National 
Geographic 
himself 
magazine 
article 
that broke the story to the world in April 1913, he knew he had 
to produce 
a big idea. He wondered 
whether 
it could have been the birthplace 
of 
the very first 
Inca, Manco the Great, and whether 
it could also have been what 
chroniclers 
described 
as 'the last city of the Incas'. 
This term refers 
to Vilcabamba, 
the settlement 
where the Incas had fled from Spanish 
invaders 
in the 1530s. 
Bingham made desperate 
attempts 
to prove this belief 
for nearly 40 years. Sadly, 
his vision 
of the site as both the beginning 
and end of the Inca civilisation, 
while 
a magnificent 
on.e, is inaccurate. 
We now know that Vilcabamba 
actually 
lies 65 
kilometres 
away in the depths of the jungle. 

G One question 
that has perplexed 
visitors, 
historians 
and archaeologists 
alike ever 
since Bingham, 
is why the site seems to have been abandoned 
before the Spanish 
Conquest. 
There are no references 
to it by any of the Spanish 
chroniclers 
-and if 
they had known of its existence 
so close to Cusco they would certainly 
have come 
in search of gold. An idea which has gained wide acceptance 
over the past few 
years is that Machu Picchu was a moya, a country 
estate built by an Inca emperor 
to escape the cold winters 
of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental 
architecture 
and spectacular 
views. Furthermore, 
the particular 
architecture 
of 
Machu Picchu suggests 
that it was constructed 
at the time of the greatest 
of all the 
Incas, 
the emperor Pachacuti 
(c. 1438-71 
). By custom, 
Pachacuti's 
descendants 
built other similar 
estates 
for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been 
abandoned 
after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish 
Conquest.

The Benefits 
of Being Bilingual 

A According 
to the latest 
figures, 
the majority 
of the world's 
population 
is now bilingual 
or multilingual, 
having grown up speaking 
two or more languages. 
In the past, such 
children 
were considered 
to be at a disadvantage 
compared 
with their monolingual 
peers. Over the past few decades, 
however, technological 
advances 
have allowed 
researchers 
to look more deeply at how bilingualism 
interacts 
with and changes 
the cognitive 
and neurological 
systems, 
thereby 
identifying 
several 
clear benefits 
of 
being bilingual. 

B Research 
shows that when a bilingual 
person uses one language, 
the other is 
active 
at the same time. When we hear a word, we don't hear the entire 
word all at 
once: the sounds arrive 
in sequential 
order. 
Long before the word is finished, 
the 
brain's 
language 
system begins to guess what that word might be. If you hear 'can', 
you will likely 
activate 
words like 'candy' 
and 'candle' 
as werl, at least during the 
earlier 
stages of word recognition. 
For bilingual 
people, 
this activation 
is not limited 
to a single 
language; 
auditory 
input activates 
corresponding 
words regardless 
of the language 
to which they belong. 
Some of the most compelling 
evidence 
for this phenomenon, 
called 
'language 
co-activation', 
comes from studying 
eye 
movements. 
A Russian-English 
bilingual 
asked to 'pick up a marker' 
from a set of 
objects 
would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn't 
know Russian, 
because the Russian 
word for 'stamp', 
marka, sounds like the English 
word he or 
she heard, 'marker'. 
In cases like this, language 
co-activation 
occurs because what 
the listener 
hears could map onto words in either 
language. 

C Having to deal with this persistent 
linguistic 
competition 
can result 
in difficulties, 
however. 
For instance, 
knowing 
more than one language 
can cause speakers 
to 
name pictures 
more slowly, and can increase 
'tip-of-the-tongue 
states', 
when you 
can almost, 
but not quite, 
bring a word to mind. As a result, 
the constant 
juggling 
of 
two languages 
creates 
a need to control 
how much a person accesses 
a language 
at any given time. For this reason, 
bilingual 
people often perform 
better 
on tasks 
that require 
conflict 
management. 
In the classic 
Stroop Task, people see a word 
and are asked to name the colour of the word's font. When the colour and the 
word match (i.e., 
the word 'red' printed 
in red), people correctly 
name the colour 
more quickly 
than when the colour and the word don't match (i.e., 
the word 'red' 
printed 
in blue). 
This occurs because the word itself 
('red') 
and its font colour (blue) 
conflict. 
Bilingual 
people often excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability 
to ignore competing 
perceptual 
information 
and focus on the relevant 
aspects 
of 
the input. 
Bilinguals 
are also better 
at switching 
between two tasks; 
for example, 
when bilinguals 
have to switch from categorizing 
objects 
by colour (red or green) 

46 

Reading 

to ·categorizing 
them by shape (circle 
or triangle), 
they do so more quickly 
than 
monolingual 
people, 
reflecting 
better 
cognitive 
control 
when having to make rapid 
cl1anges of strategy. 

D It also seems that the neurological 
roots of the bilingual 
advantage 
extend to brain 
ar-eas more traditionally 
associated 
with sensory 
processing. 
When monolingual 
and bilingual 
adolescents 
listen 
to simple speech sounds without 
any intervening 
background 
noise, 
they show highly 
similar 
brain stem responses. 
When 
researchers 
play the same sound to both groups in the presence 
of background 
noise, 
however, 
the bilingual 
listeners' 
neural 
response 
is considerably 
larger, 
reflecting 
better 
encoding 
of the sound's 
fundamental 
frequenc
y, a feature 
of sound 
closely 
related 
to pitch perception. 

E Such improvements 
in cognitive 
and sensory 
processing 
may help a bilingual 
person to process 
information 
in the environment, 
and help explain 
why bilingual 
adults 
acquire 
a third language 
better 
than monolingual 
adults 
master a second 
language. 
This advantage 
may be rooted in the skill 
of focussing 
on information 
about the new language 
while reducing 
interference 
from the languages 
they 
al ready know. 

F Research 
also indicates 
that bilingual 
experience 
may help to keep the cognitive 
mechanisms 
sharp by recruiting 
alternate 
brain networks 
to compensate 
for those 
that become damaged during 
aging. 
Older bilinguals 
enjoy improved 
memory 
relative 
to monolingual 
people, 
which can lead to real-world 
health 
benefits. 
In a 
study of over 200 patients 
with Alzheimer's 
disease, 
a degenerative 
brain disease, 
bilingual patients 
reported 
showing 
initial 
symptoms 
of the disease 
an average 
of five years later than monolingual 
patients. 
In a follow-up 
study, researchers 
compared 
the brains 
of bilingual 
and monolingual 
patients 
matched on the severity 
of Alzheimer's 
symptoms. 
Surprisingly, 
the bilinguals' 
brains 
had more physical 
signs of disease 
than their monolingual 
counterparts, 
even though their outward 
behaviour 
and abilities 
were the same. If the brain is an engine, 
bilingualism 
may 
help it to go farther 
on the same amount of fuel. 

G Furthermore, 
the benefits 
associated 
with bilingual 
experience 
seem to start 
very early. In one study, 
researchers 
taught 
seven-month-old 
babies growing 
up·in monolingual 
or bilingual 
homes that when they heard a tinkling 
sound, a 
puppet appeared 
on one side of a screen. 
Halfway 
through 
the study, 
the puppet 
began appearing 
on the opposite 
side of the screen. 
In order to get a reward, 
the 
infants 
had to adjust 
the rule they'd 
learned; 
only the bilingual 
babies were able to 
successfully 
learn the new rule. This suggests 
that for very young children, 
as well 
as for older people, 
navigating 
a multilingual 
environment 
imparts 
advantages 
that 
transfer 
far beyond language.

Flying tortoises 

An airborne 
reintroduction 
programme 
has helped conservationists 
take 
significant 
steps to protect 
the endangered 
Galapagos tortoise. 

A Forests 
of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains 
that separate 
the 
of the Galapagos 
island 
of lsabela 
from the Pacific 
Ocean. With its 
interior 
five distinct volcanoes, the 
island 
resembles 
a lunar landscape. 
Only the thick 
vegetation 
at the skirt of the often cloud-covered 
peak of Sierra Negra offers 
respite 
from the barren terrain below. 
This inhospitable 
environment 
is home to the giant 
Galapagos 
tortoise. Some 
time after the Galapagos's 
birth, 
around five 
million 
y ears ago, the islands 
were colonised 
by one or more tortoises 
from mainland 
South America. 
As these ancestral 
tortoises 
settled 
on the individual 
islands, 
the 
different 
populations adapted 
to their unique environments, 
giving 
rise to at least 
14 different subspecies. 
Island 
life agreed with them. In the absence of significant 
predators, 
they grew to become the largest 
and longest-living 
tortoises 
on the 
planet, 
weighing 
more than 400 kilograms, 
occasionally 
exceeding 
1.8 metres in 
length and living 
for more than a century. 

8 Before human arrival, 
the archipelago's 
tortoises 
numbered 
in the hundreds 
of thousands. 
From the 17th century 
onwards, 
pirates 
took a few on board for 
food, but the arrival 
of whaling 
ships in the 1790s saw this exploitation 
grow 
exponentially. 
Relatively 
immobile 
and capable 
of surviving 
for months without food 
or water, the tortoises 
were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies 
during long ocean passages. 
Sometimes, 
their bodies were processed 
into high­
grade oil. In total, 
an estimated 
200,000 animals 
were taken from the archipelago 
before the 20th century. 
This historical 
exploitation 
was then exacerbated 
when 
settlers 
came to the islands. 
They hunted the tortoises 
and destroyed 
their habitat 
to clear land for agriculture. 
They also introduced 
alien species 
-ranging 
from 
cattle, 
pigs, goats, rats and dogs to plants and ants -that either 
prey on the eggs 
and young tortoises 
or damage or destroy 
their habitat. 

C Today, only 11 of the original 
subspecies 
survive 
and of these, several 
are highly 
endangered. 
In 1989, work began on a tortoise-breeding 
centre just outside 
the 
town of Puerto Villamil 
on lsabela, 
dedicated 
to protecting 
the island's 
tortoise 
populations. 
The centre's 
captive-breeding 
programme 
proved to be extremely 
successful, 
and it eventually 
had to deal with 
an overpopulation 
problem. 

D The problem 
was also a pressing 
one. Captive-bred 
tortoises 
can't be reintroduced 
into the wild until they're 
at least five years old and weigh at least 4.5 kilograms, 
at which point their size and weight -and their hardened 
shells 
-are sufficient 
to protect 
them from predators. 
But if people wait too long after that point, 
the 
tortoises 
eventually 
become too large to transport. 

60 

Reading 

E For years, repatriation 
efforts 
were carried 
out in small numbers, 
with the tortoises 
carried 
on the backs of men over weeks of long, treacherous 
hikes along narrow 
trails. 
But in November 
2010, the environmentalist 
and Galapagos 
National 
Park 
liaison 
officer 
Godfrey 
Merlin, 
a visiting 
private 
motor yacht captain 
and a helicopter 
pilot gathered 
around a table in a small cafe in Puerto Ayora on the island 
of Santa 
Cruz to work out more ambitious 
reintroduction. 
The aim was to use a helicopter 
to move 300 of the breeding 
centre's 
tortoises 
to various 
locations 
close to Sierra 
Negra. 

F This unprecedented 
effort 
was made possible 
by the owners of the 67-metre 
yacht White Cloud, who provided 
the Galapagos 
National 
Park with free use of 
their helicopter 
and its experienced 
pilot, 
as well as the logistical 
support 
of the 
yacht, its captain 
and crew. Originally 
an air ambulance, 
the yacht's 
helicopter 
has a rear double door and a large internal 
space that's 
well suited 
for cargo, 
so a custom crate was designed 
to hold up to 33 tortoises 
with a total weight of 
about 150 kilograms. 
This weight, 
together 
with that of the fuel, pilot and four crew, 
approached 
the helicopter's 
maximum payload, 
and there were times when it was 
clearly 
right on the edge of the helicopter's 
capabilities. 
During a period of three 
days, a group of volunteers 
from the breeding 
centre worked around the clock to 
prepare 
the young tortoises 
for transport. 
Meanwhile, 
park wardens, 
dropped 
off 
ahead of time in remote locations, 
cleared 
landing 
sites within 
the thick brush, cacti 
and lava rocks. 

G Upon their release, 
the juvenile 
tortoises 
quickly 
spread out over their ancestral 
territory, investigating 
their new surroundings 
and feeding 
on the vegetation. 
Eventually, 
one tiny tortoise 
came across a fully grown giant who had been 
lumbering 
around the island 
for around a hundred years. The two stood side by 
side, a powerful 
symbol of the regeneration 
of an ancient 
species.

The Intersection

and Geography 

A While many diseases 
that affect 
humans have been eradicated 
due to 
improvements 
in vaccinations 
and the availability 
of healthcare, 
there are still 
areas 
around the world where certain 
health issues are more prevalent. 
In a world that is 
far more globalised 
than ever before, 
people come into contact 
with one another 
through 
travel 
and living 
closer 
and closer to each other. 
As a result, 
super-viruses 
and other infections 
resistant 
to antibiotics 
are becoming 
more and more common. 

B Geography 
can often play a very large role in the health concerns 
of certain 
populations. 
For instance, 
depending 
on where you live, you will not have the same 
health concerns 
as someone who lives in a different 
geographical 
region. 
Perhaps 
one of the most obvious 
examples 
of this idea is malaria-prone 
areas, which are 
usually 
tropical 
regions 
that foster 
a warm and damp environment 
in which the 
mosquitos 
that can give people this disease 
can grow. Malarip 
is much less of a 
problem 
in high-altitude 
deserts, 
for instance. 

C In some countries, 
geographical 
factors 
influence 
the health and well-being 
of 
the population 
in very obvious 
ways. In many large cities, 
the wind is not strong 
enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution 
that cause 
asthma, 
lung problems, 
eyesight 
issues and more in the people who live there. 
Part 
of the problem 
is, of course, 
the massive number of cars being driven, 
in addition 
to factories 
that run on coal power. The rapid industrialisation 
of some countries 
in 
recent years has also led to the cutting 
down of forests 
to allow for the expansion 
of 
big cities, 
which makes it even harder to fight the pollution 
with the fresh air that is 
produced 
by plants. 

D It is in situations 
like these that the field of health geography 
comes into its own. It 
is an increasingly 
important 
area of study in a world where diseases 
like polio are 
re-emerging,-
respiratory 
diseases 
continue 
to spread, 
and malaria-prone 
areas 
are still 
fighting 
to find a better 
cure. Health geography 
is the combination 
of, on 
the one hand, knowledge 
regarding 
geography 
and methods used to analyse 
and -­
interpret 
geographical 
information, 
and on the other, 
the study of health, 
diseases 
and healthcare 
practices 
around the world. The aim of this hybrid science 
is to 
create solutions 
for common geography-based 
health problems. 
While people will 
always be prone to illness, 
the study of how geography 
affects 
our health could 
lead to the eradication 
of certain 
illnesses, 
and the prevention 
of others in the 
future. 
By understanding 
why and how we get sick, we can change the way we 
treat illness 
and disease 
specific 
to certain 
geographical 
locations.

Test 7 

E The geography 
of disease 
and ill health analyses 
the frequency 
with which certain 
diseases 
appear in different 
parts of the world, and overlays 
the data with the 
geography 
of the region, 
to see if there could be a correlation 
between the two. 
Health geographers 
also study factors 
that could make certain 
individuals 
or a 
population 
more likely 
to be taken ill with a specific 
health concern 
or disease, 
as 
compared 
with the population 
of another 
area. Health geographers 
in this field 
are usually 
trained 
as healthcare 
workers, 
and have an understanding 
of basic 
epidemiology 
as it relates 
to the spread of diseases 
among the population. 

F Researchers 
study the interactions 
between humans and their environment 
that 
could lead to illness 
(such as asthma in places with high levels 
of pollution) 
and 
work to create a clear way of categorising 
illnesses, 
diseases 
and epidemics 
into 
local and global 
scales. 
Health geographers 
can map the spread of illnesses 
and 
attempt 
to identify 
the reasons 
behind an increase 
or decrease 
in illnesses, 
as 
they work to find a way to halt the further 
spread or re-emergence 
of diseases 
in 
vulnerable 
populations. 

G The second subcategory 
of health geography 
is the geography 
of healthcare 
provision. 
This group studies 
the availability 
(or lack thereof) 
of healthcare 
resources 
to individuals 
and populafrons 
around the world. In both developed 
and 
developing 
nations 
there is often a very large discrepancy 
between the options 
available 
to people in different 
social 
classes, 
income brackets, 
and levels 
of 
education. 
Individuals 
working 
in the area of the geography 
of healthcare 
provision 
attempt 
to assess the levels 
of healthcare 
in the area (for instance, 
it may be very 
difficult 
for people to get medical 
attention 
because there is a mountain 
between 
their village 
and the nearest 
hospital). 
These researchers 
are on the frontline 
of 
making recommendations 
regarding 
policy 
to international 
organisations, 
local 
government 
bodies and others. 

H The field of health geography 
is often overlooked, 
but it constitutes 
a huge area 
of need in the fields 
of geography 
and healthcare. 
If we can understand 
how 
geography 
affects 
our health no matter where in the world we are located, 
we can 
better 
treat disease, 
prevent 
illness, 
and keep people safe and well.

Passage 3.

Music and the emotions 

Neuroscientist 
Jonah Lehrer considers 
the emotional 
power of music 

Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, 
music is a purely abstract 
art form, 
devoid of language 
or explicit 
ideas. 
And yet, even though music says little, 
it still 
manages to touch us deeply. When listening 
to our favourite 
songs, our body betrays 
all 
the symptoms 
of emotional 
arousal. 
The pupils 
in our eyes dilate, our 
pulse and blood 
pressure 
rise, the electrical 
conductance 
of our skin is lowered, 
and the cerebellum, 
a 
brain region associated 
with bodily 
movement, 
becomes strangely 
active. 
Blood is even 
re-directed 
to the 
muscles 
in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological 
roots. 

A recent paper in Nature Neuroscience 
by a research 
team in Montreal, 
Canada, marks 
an important 
step in revealing 
the precise 
1.mderpinnings 
of 'the potent pleasurable 
stimulus' 
that is music. Although 
the study involves 
plenty 
of fancy technology, 
including 
functional 
magnetic resonance 
imaging 
(fMRI) and ligand-based 
positron 
emission 
tomography 
(PET) scanning, 
the experiment 
itself 
was rather straightforward. 
After 
screening 
217 individuals 
who responded 
to advertisements 
requesting 
people who 
experience 
'chills' 
to instrumental 
music, the scientists 
narrowed 
down the subject 
pool 
to ten. They then asked the subjects 
to bring in their playlist 
of favourite 
songs -virtually 
every genre was represented, 
from techno to tango -and played them the music while 
their brain activity 
was monitored. 
Because the scientists 
were combining 
methodologies 
(PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively 
exact and detailed 
portrait 
of 
music in the brain. 
The first 
thing they discovered 
is that music triggers 
the production 
of dopamine 
- a chemical 
with a key role in setting 
people's 
moods -by the neurons 
(nerve cells) 
in both the dorsal and ventral 
regions 
of the brain. 
As these two regions 
have long been linked 
with the experience 
of pleasure, 
this finding 
isn't particularly 
surprising. 

What is rather 
more significant 
is the finding 
that the dopamine 
neurons 
in the 
caudate 
- a region of the brain involved 
in learning 
stimulus-response 
associations, 
and in anticipating 
food and other 'reward' 
stimuli 
-were at their most active 
around 
15 seconds before the participants' 
favourite 
moments in the music. The researchers 
call this the 'anticipatory 
phase' and argue that the purpose 
of this activity 
is to help 
us predict 
the arrival 
of our 
favourite 
part. The question, 
of course, 
is what all these 
dopamine 
neurons are up 
to. Why are they so 
active 
in the period preceding 
the 
acoustic 
climax? After all, 
we typically 
associate surges 
of dopamine 
with pleasure, 
with 
the processing 
of actual 
rewards. 
And yet, this cluster 
of cells is most active 
when the 
'chills' have yet 
to arrive, 
when the melodic 
pattern 
is still 
unresolved. 

66 

Reading 

One way to answer the question 
is to look at the music and not the neurons. 
While 
music can often seem (at least to the outsider) 
like a labyrinth 
of intricate 
patterns, 
it 
turns out that the most important 
part of every song or symphony 
is when the patterns 
break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. 
If the music is too obvious, 
it is 
annoyingly 
boring, 
like an alarm clock. 
Numerous 
studies, 
after all, have demonstrated 
that dopamine 
neurons 
quickly 
adapt to predictable 
rewards. 
If we know what's going 
to happen next, then we don't get excited. 
This is why composers 
often introduce 
a 
key note in the beginning 
of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious 
avoidance 
of the pattern, 
and then finally 
repeat it only at the end. The longer 
we are 
denied the pattern 
we expect, 
the greater 
the emotional 
release 
when the pattern 
returns, 
safe and sound. 

To demonstrate 
this psychological 
principle, 
the musicologist 
Leonard 
Meyer, in his 
book Emotion 
and Meaning in Music (1956), 
analysed 
the 5th movement 
of 
classic 
Beethoven's 
String 
Quartet 
in C-sharp 
minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how 
music is defined 
by its flirtation 
with -but not submission 
to -our expectations 
of order. 
Meyer dissected 
50 measures 
(bars) 
of the masterpiece, 
showing 
how Beethoven 
begins with the clear statement 
of a rhythmic 
and harmonic 
pattern 
and then, in an 
ingenious 
tonal dance, carefully 
holds off repeating 
it. What Beethoven 
does instead 
is 
suggest 
variations 
of th� pattern. 
He wants to preserve 
an element 
of uncertainty 
in his 
music, making our brains 
beg for the one chord he refuses 
to give us. Beethoven 
saves 
that chord for the end. 

According 
to Meyer, it is the suspenseful 
tension 
of music, arising 
out of our unfulfilled 
expectations, 
that is the source of the music's 
feeling. 
While earlier 
theories 
of music 
focused 
on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences 
-its 
'connotative' 
meaning 
-Meyer argued that the emotions 
we find in music come from the 
unfolding 
events of the music itself. 
This 'embodied 
meaning' 
arises 
from the patterns 
the symphony 
invokes 
and then ignores. 
It is this uncertainty 
that triggers 
the surge 
of dopamine 
in the caudate, 
as we struggle 
to figure 
out what will happen next. We 
can predict 
some of the notes, 
but we can't predict 
them all, and that is what keeps us 
listening, 
waiting 
expectantly 
for our reward, 
for the pattern 
to be completed.

UK companies 
need more effective 
boards of directors 

A After a number of serious 
failures 
of governance 
(that is, how they are managed 
at the highest 
level), 
companies 
in Britain, 
as well as elsewhere, 
should consider 
radical 
changes 
to their directors' 
roles. 
It is clear that the role of a board director 
today is not an easy one. Following 
the 2008 financial 
meltdown, 
which resulted 
in 
a deeper and more prolonged 
period 
of economic 
downturn 
than anyone expected, 
the search for explanations 
in the many post-mortems 
of the crisis 
has meant 
blame has been spread far and wide. Governments, 
regulators, 
central 
banks and 
auditors 
have all been in the frame. The role of bank directors 
and management 
and their widely publicised 
failures 
have been extensively 
picked over and 
examined 
in reports, 
inquiries 
and commentaries. 

B The knock-on 
effect of this scrutiny 
has been to make the governance 
of 
companies 
in general 
an issue of intense 
public 
debate and has significantly 
increased 
the pressures 
on, and the responsibilities 
of, directors. 
At the simplest 
and most practical 
level, 
the time involved 
in fulfilling 
the demands of a board 
directorship 
has increased 
signific
antly, calling 
into question 
the effectiveness 
of 
the classic 
model of corporate 
governance 
by part-time, 
independent 
non-executive 
directors. 
Where once a board schedule 
may have consisted 
of between 
eight and 
ten meetings 
a year, in many companies 
the number of events requiring 
board 
input and decisions 
has dramatically 
risen. 
Furthermore, 
the amount of reading 
and preparation 
required 
for each meeting 
is increasing. 
Agendas can become 
overloaded 
and this can mean the time for constructive 
debate must necessarily 
be 
restricted 
in favour of getting 
through 
the business. 

C Often, board business 
is devolved 
to committees 
in order to cope with the 
workload, 
which may be more efficient 
but can mean that the board as a whole 
is less involved 
in fully addressing 
some of the most important 
issues. 
It is not 
uncommon for the audit committee 
meeting 
to last longer 
than the main board 
meeting 
itself. 
Process 
may take the place of discussion 
and be at the expense 
of 
real collaboration, 
so that boxes are ticked 
rather 
than issues 
tackled. 

D A radical 
solution, 
which may work for some very large companies 
whose 
businesses 
are extensive 
and complex, 
is the professional 
board, whose members­
would work up to three or four days a week, supported 
by their own dedicated 
staff 
and advisers. 
There are obvious 
.. risks to this-and it would be important 
to establish 
clear guidelines 
for such a board to ensure that it did not step on the toes of 
management 
by becoming 
too engaged in the day-to-day 
running 
of the company.

of recruitment, 
remuneration 
and independence 
could also arise and this 
structure 
would not be appropriate 
for all companies. 
However, 
more professional 
and better-inf
ormed boards would have been particularly 
appropriate 
for banks 
had access to information 
where the executives 
that part-time 
non-executive 
directors 
lacked, 
leaving 
the latter 
unable to comprehend 
or anticipate 
the 2008 
crash.

Test 8 

E One of the main criticisms 
of boards and their directors 
is that they do not focus 
sufficiently 
on longer-term 
matters 
of strategy, 
sustainability 
and governance, 
but instead 
concentrate 
too much on short-term 
financial 
metrics. 
Regulatory 
requirements 
and the structure 
of the market encourage 
this behaviour. 
The tyranny 
of quarterly 
reporting 
can distort 
board decision-making, 
as directors 
have to 'make 
the numbers' 
every four months to meet the insatiable 
appetite 
of the market for 
more data. This serves to encourage 
the trading 
methodology 
of a certain 
kind of 
investor 
who moves in and out of a stock without 
engaging 
in constructive 
dialogue 
with the company about strategy 
or performance, 
and is simply seeking 
a short­
term financial 
gain. This effect 
has been made worse by the changing 
profile 
of 
investors 
due to the globalisation 
of capital 
and the increasing 
use of automated 
trading 
systems. 
Corporate 
culture 
adapts and management 
teams are largely 
incentivised 
to meet financial 
goals. 

F Compensation 
for chief executives 
has become a combat zone where pitched 
battles 
between investors, 
management 
and board members are fought, 
often 
behind closed doors but increasingly 
frequently 
in the full glare of press attention. 
Many would argue that this is in the interest 
of transparency 
and good governance 
as shareholders 
use their muscle in, the area of pay to pressure 
boards to 
remove underperforming 
chief executives. 
Their powers to vote down executive 
remuneration 
policies 
increased 
when binding 
votes came into force. 
The chair 
of the remuneration 
committee 
can be an exposed and lonely 
role, as Alison 
Carnwath, 
chair of Barclays 
Bank's remuneration 
committee, 
found when she had 
to resign, 
having been roundly 
criticised 
for trying 
to defend the enormous 
bonus 
to be paid to the chief executive; 
the irony being that she was widely understood 
to 
have spoken out against 
it in the privacy 
of the committee. 

G The financial 
crisis 
stimulated 
a debate about the role and purpose 
of the company 
and a heightened 
awareness 
of corporate 
ethics. 
Trust in the corporation 
has been 
eroded and academics 
such as Michael 
Sandel, 
in his thoughtful 
and bestselling 
book What Money Can't Buy, are questioning 
the morality 
of capitalism 
and the 
market economy. Boards of companies 
in all sectors 
will need to widen their 
perspective 
to encompass 
these issues and this may involve 
a realignment 
of 
corporate 
goals. 
We live in challenging 
times.

SECTION 1 

that Example 

TC EMPLOYEE: 
Hi. Can I help you? 
vIsITOR: I'd like to find out if you have any excursions 
suitable 
for families. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. How about taking 
your family 
for a cruise? 
We have a steamship 
takes passengers 
out several 
times a day -it's over 100 years old. 
VISITOR: That sounds interesting. 
How long is the trip? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
About an hour and a half. And don't forget 
to take pictures 
of the mountains. 
01 
They're 
all around you when you're 
on the boat and they look fantastic. 
vIsIToR: OK. And I assume there's 
a cafe or something 
on board? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. How old are your children? 
vIs1TOR: Er, my daughter's 
fifteen 
and my son's seven. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Right. 
Well there are various 
things 
you can do once you've crossed 
the lake, 
to make a day of it. One thing that's 
very popular 
is a visit 
to the Country 
Farm. 
You're 
met off the boat by the farmer and he'll 
take you to the holding 
pens, 
where the sheep are kept. Children 
love feeding 
them! 
vIsITOR: My son would love that. He really 
likes animals. 
Tc EMPLOYEE: 
Well, there's 
also a 40-minute 
trek round the farm on a horse, 
if he wants. 02 
vIsIToR: Do you think he'd manage it? He hasn't 
done that before. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure. It's suitable 
for complete 
beginners. 
vIsITOR: Ah, good. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
And again, 
visitors 
are welcome to explore 
the farm on their own, as long 
as th�y take care to close gates and so on. There are some very beautiful 03 
gardens 
along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm -they'll 
be 
just at their best now. You could easily 
spend an hour or two there. 
vIsITOR: OK. Well that all sounds good. And can we get lunch there? 
04 
You can, and it's very good, though it's not included 
in the basic cost. You pay 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
when you get there. 
VISITOR: Right. 

vIsITOR: So is there anything 
else to do over on that side of the lake? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling 
tril?'. There's 
a _trail 
ther.e 
called 
the Back �oad -: you could ea?ily 
spen_9 
three 
or four hours exploring 
it, and the scenery's 
wonderful. 
They'll 
give you a map 05 
when you get your ticket 
for the cruise 
-there's 
no extra charge. 
vIsITOR: What's the trail 
like in terms of difficulty? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Quite challenging 
in places. 
It wouldn't 
be suitable 
for your seven-year-old. 
lL 06 
needs someone who's got a bit more experience. 
v1sITOR: Hmm. Well, my daughter 
loves cycling 
and so do I, so maybe the two of us 
could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm. That might work out 
quite well. But we don't have bikes here ... is there somewhere 
we could 
rent them? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Yes, there's 
a place here in the city. 
It's called 
Ratchesons. 
vIsITOR: I'll just make a note of that -er, how do you spell it? 

07 

95 

Audioscripts 

TC EMPLOYEE: 
R-A-T-C-H-E-S-O-N-S. 
It's just by the cruise ship terminal.
VISITOR: OK. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
You'd also need to pick up a repair 
kit for the bike from there to take along 
with 
you, and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -it'd be best to get 
those in the city. 
vIsIToR: Fine. That shouldn't 
be a problem. 
And I assume I can rent a helmet from the QB 
bike place? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure, you should definitely 
get that. It's a great ride, but you want to be well 
prepared 
because it's very remote -you won't see any shops round there, 
or Q9 
anywhere 
to stay. so you need to get back in time for the last boat. 
vIsITOR: Yeah. So what sort of prices 
are we looking 
at here? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Let's see, that'd 
be one adult and one child for the cruise 
with farm tour, 
that's 
$117, and an adult and a child for the cruise 
only so that's $214 
dollars 
altogether. 
Oh, wait a minute, 
how old did you say your daughter 
was? 
VISITOR: Fifteen. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Then I'm afraid it's 
$267 because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75 Q10 
instead 
of the child fare which is $22 -sorry about that. 
vIsITOR: That's OK. Er, so how do ... 

SECTION 2 

Good morning 
everyone. 
My name's Joy Parkins 
and I'm the restaurant 
manager. 
And I 
understand 
that none of you've had any previous 
experience 
as kitchen 
assistants? 
Well, 
you might be feeling 
a bit nervous 
now, but most of our kitchen assistants 
say they enjoy the 
work. OK, they might get shouted 
at sometimes, 
but it's nothing 
personal, 
and they're 
pleased 
that they have so many different 
things to do, which means they never get bored. And I'll 
tell you straightaway 
that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving 
you 
some more responsibility. 

Q11 

Right, 
well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent 
start. 
Now I'm glad to see none 
of you have unsuitable 
footwear, 
so that's good 
-you need to be careful 
as the floors 
can get 
very wet and slippery. 
Those of you with long hair 
have got it well out of the way, but some 
of 
you'll 
need to remove your rings and bracelets 
-just put them somewhere 
safe for today, and 
remember 
to leave them at home tomorrow, as 
they can be a safety 
hazard. 

Q12 

Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -we don't have any tables 
free for this 
evening, 
and only a few for lunch. Fortunately 
we've got our Head Chef back -he was away 
on holiday 
all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work. Now, I'll tell you a bit 
more about the job in a minute but first, 
some general 
regulations. 
For all of you, whatever 
your age, there's 
some equipment 
you mustn't 
use until you've been properly 
trained, like 
the waste disposal system 
for example, 
for health and safety reasons. 
Then I think there are 
two of you here who are 
under 18 -that's 
Emma and Jake, isn't it? Right. 
so for you two, the 
meat slicer 
is out of bounds. 
And of course none of you are allowed 
to use the electric 
mixer 
until you've been shown how it works. 

Q13 

Q14 

Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful 
job, and I have to say that can be true. 
be working 
an eight-hour 
day for the first 
week, though you'll 
have the chance to do 
You'll 
overtime 
after that 
as well if you want to. But however long the hours 
are, you'll 
get a break 
in the middle. 
What you will find is that you're 
on your feet all day long, lifting 
and carrying, 
so 
if you're not fit now you soon will be! You'll find 
you don't have 
much chance to take it easy -
when someone tells you to do something 
you need to do it straightaway 
-but at least we do 
have a very efficient 
air conditioning 
system compared 
with some kitchens. 

Q16 

Q15 & 

96 

Tests 

Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know. So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins Q17
and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for. 
I'll be trying 
to get 
you to work with as many different people 
in the kitchen 
as possible, 
so that you learn while 
you're 
on the job. One person whose name you must remember 
is David Field. 
If you injure Q18
yourself 
at all, even if it's really 
minor, 
you must report 
to him and he'll make sure the incident 
is recorded 
and you get the appropriate treatment. 
He's trained 
to give basic treatment 
to 
staff himself, 
or he'll send 
you off somewhere 
else if necessary. 
Then there's 
Dexter Wills 
he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something 
like that. Don't just leave 
it and hope no one will notice 
-it's really 
important 
to get things 
noted and replaced 
or there 
could be problems 
later. 
And finally, 
there's 
Mike Smith. He's the member of staff who takes Q20
care of all the stores 
of perishables. 
so if you notice 
we're getting 
low in flour or sugar or 
something. 
make sure you let him know so he can put 
in an order. 

- Q19

OK, now the next thing ... 

SECTION 3 

TRUDIE: OK, Stewart. 
We need to start planning 
our paper on public 
libraries. 
Have you 
thought 
of an angle yet? 
STEWART: Well, there's 
so much we could look into. How libraries 
have changed 
over the 
centuries, 
for instance, 
or how different 
countries 
organise 
them. What do you
think, 
Trudie? 
TRUDIE: Maybe we should concentrate 
on.this country, 
and try and relate 
the changes 
libraries 
to external 
developments. 
like the fact that far 
more people can read than 
a century ago, and that the local population 
may speak lots of different 
languages. 
STEWART: We could include 
something 
about changes 
in the source of funding, 
too. 
TRUDIE: Yes, but remember 
we're only supposed 
to write a short paper, 
so it's probably 
best if we don't go into funding 
in any detail. 
Well, shall we just brainstorm 
a few ideas, 
to get started? 
TRUDIE: OK. We obviously 
need to look at the impact of new technology, 
particularly 
the 
internet. 
Now that lots of books have been digitalised, 
people can access them 
from their own computers 
at home. 
STEWART: And if everyone 
did that, libraries 
would be obsolete. 

STEWART: Right. 

in Q21 

TRUDIE: Yes. 

Q22 

TRUDIE: That's 

STEWART: But the digitalised 
books that are available 
on line for free are mostly out of 
copyright. 
aren't 
they? And copyright 
in this country lasts for 70 years after the 
author dies. So you won't find the latest 
best-seller 
or up-to-date 
information. 
an important 
point.Aoyway, 
I findit_hard
_to • .concentrate 
when I'm.reading 
a 
long text on a screen. 
I'd much rather 
read a physical 
book. And it takes longer 
to 
read on a screen. 
STEWART: Oh, I prefer 
it. I suppose 
it's just a personal 
preference. 
TRUDIE: Mm. I expect that libraries 
will go on evolving 
in the next few years. 
Some have 
already 
become centres 
where community 
activities 
take place, 
like local clubs 
meeting 
there. 
I think that'll 
become even more common. 
STEWART: I'd like to think so, and that they'll 
still 
be serving 
their traditional 
function, 
but I'm 
not so sure. There are financial 
implications, 
after all. What I'm afraid 
will happen is Q23
that books and magazines 
will all disappear. 
and there'll 
just be rows and rows of 
computers. 
They won't look anything 
like the libraries we're 
used to. 
TRUDIE: Well, we'll see. 

97 

Audioscripts 

TRUDIE: Right. 

TRUDIE: I've just had an idea. Why don't we make an in-depth 
study of our local public 
library 
as background 
to our paper? 
STEWART: Yes, that'd 
be interesting, 
and raise all sorts of issues. 
Let's make a list of possible 
things 
we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure. 
For instance, 
um. Q24
we could interview 
some of the staff, 
and find out whether 
the library 
has its own 
budget, 
or if that's 
controlled 
by the local council. 
TRUDIE: And what their policies 
are. I know they don't allow food, but I'd love to find out 
what types of noise they ban -there always seems to 
be a lot of talking, 
but never 
music. I don't know if that's 
a policy 
or it just happens. 
STEWART: Ah, I've often 
wondered. 
Then there are things 
like how the library 
is affected 
by Q25 
employment 
laws. I suppose there are rules about working 
hours, facilities for 
staff, 
and so on. 
Then there are other issues relating 
to the design of the building 
and how Q26 
customers use 
it. Like what measures does the 
library 
take to ensure their safety? 
They'd need floor coverings 
that aren't 
slippery, 
and emergency exits, 
for instance. 
Oh, and another 
thing -there's 
the question 
of the kind of insurance 
the library Q27
needs to have, in case anyone gets injured. 
STEWART: Yes, that's 
something 
else to find out. You know something 
I've often wondered? 
TRUDIE What's that? 
STEWART: Well, you know they've 
got an archive 
of local newspapers 
going back years? Well, 
next to it they've 
got the diary of a well-known 
politician 
from the late 19th century. 
I wonder why it's there. 
Do you know what his con_nection 
was with this area? 
TRUDIE: No idea. Let's add it to our list of things 
to find out. Oh., I've just thought 
-you know Q29
people might ask in the iibrary 
about local organisations, 
lik� sports clubs? Well. I 
wonder if they keep a database, 
or whether 
they just look online. 
I quite fancy finding 
out what the differences 
are between a library 
that's Q30
open to the public 
and one that's 
part of a museum, for example -they must be 
very different. 
TRUDIE: Mmm. Then something 
else I'd like to know is ... 

STEWART: Right. 

Q28

SECTION 4 

In public 
discussion 
of business, 
we take certain 
values for granted. 
Today I'm going to talk 
about four of them: collaboration, 
hard work, creativity 
and excellence. 
Most people would 
say they're 
all 'good things'. 
I'm going to suggest 
that's 
an over-simple 
view. 

The trouble with these 
values is that they're 
theoretical 
concepts, 
removed from the reality 
of 
day-to-day 
business. 
Pursue values by all means. but be prepared 
for what may happen as a Q31
result. 
They can actually 
cause damage, which is not at all the intention. 

Business 
leaders 
generally 
try to do the right thing. 
But all too often the right thing backfires, 
if those leaders 
adopt values without 
understanding and 
managing 
the side effects 
that arise. 
The values can easily 
get in the way of what's actually 
intended. 

Q32 

OK. So the first 
value I'm going to discuss 
is collaboration. 
Er, let me give you an example. 
On a management 
training 
course I once attended, 
we were put into groups and had to Q33 
construct 
a bridge across a stream, 
using building 
blocks that we were given. 
The rule was 
that everyone 
in the team had to move at least one building 
block during the construction. 
This was intended 
to encourage 
teamwork. 

98 

Test5 

But it was really 
a job best done by one person. 
The other teams tried to collaborate 
building 
the structure, 
and descended 
into confusion, 
with everyone 
getting 
in each other's 
way. Our team leader 
solved the challenge 
brilliantly. 
She simply asked everyone 
in the team 
to move a piece a few centimetres, 
to comply with the rule, and 
then let the person in the 
team with an aptitude 
for puzzles 
like this build it alone. 
We finished 
before any other team. 
My point is that the task wasn't 
really 
suited 
to teamworking, 
so why make it one? 

on Q34 

Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency 
- a common cause of poor sales. 
In the case of Q35 
a smartphone 
that a certain 
company launched, 
one director 
wanted to target 
the business 
market. and another demanded 
it was aimed at consumers. 
The company wanted both 
directors 
to be involved, 
so gave the product 
a consumer-friendly 
name. but marketed 
it to 
companies. 
The result was 
that it met the needs of neither 
group. It would have been better 
to let one director 
or the other have his way, not both. 

Now industriousness, 
or hard work. It's easy to mock people who say they 
work hard: after 
all, a hamster 
running around 
in a wheel is working 
hard -and getting nowhere. 
Of course 
hard work is valuable, 
but only when properly 
targeted. 
Otherwise 
it wastes the resources Q36 
that companies 
value most -time and energy. 
And that's 
bad for the organisation. 
There's 
a management 
model that groups people according 
to four criteria: 
clever, hard-
working, 
stupid 
and lazy. Here 'lazy' 
means having a rational 
determination 
not to carry out Q37 
unnecessary 
tasks. 
It doesn't 
mean trying to 
avoid work altogether. 
Most people display 
two 
of these characteristics, 
and the most 
valuable 
people are those who 
are both clever

Instead 
of throwing

This often 
works well -creating 
an attention-grabbing 
TV 
commercial, 
for example, 
might lead to increased 
sales. 
But it isn't 
always a good thing. 
Some advertising 
campaigns 
are remembered 
for their creativity, 
without having 
any effect 
on sales. 
This happened 
a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate 
bar: subsequent Q38 
research 
showed that plenty 
of consumers remembered 
the adverts. 
but had no idea what 
was being advertised. 
The trouble 
is that the creator 
derives 
pleasure 
from coming up with 
the idea, and wrongly 
assumes the audience 
for the campaign 
will share that feeling. 

A company that brings 
out thousands 
of new products 
may seem more creative 
than a 
company that only has a few, but it may be 
creative, 
and make smaller 
profits. 
Creativity 
needs to be targeted. 
to solve a problem 
that the company has identified. 
Just coming up with 
more and more novel products 
isn't necessarily 
a good thing.

Good morning, Kenton Festival box office. How can I help you? 
WOMAN: Oh, good morning. I'm coming to Kenton for a few days' holiday next month, and a 
friend told me there's a festival. She gave me this number to find out about it . 
That's right, the festival begins on the 16 th of May and goes on till the 19 th
WOMAN: Oh, that's great. I'll be there from the 15 th till the 19 th
. So could you tell me the 
programme, please? 
Well, on the first day, there's the opening ceremony, in the town centre. People start 
gathering around 2 o'clock, to get a good place to see from, and the events will start 01
at 2.45, and finish about 5.30. 
WOMAN: OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there early to get a good spot. 
The festival will be officially opened by the mayor. He'll just speak for a few minutes, 
welcoming everyone to the festival. All the town councillors will be there, and of 
course lots of other people. 
WOMAN: Right. 
Then there'll be a performance by a band. Most years we have a children's choir,

of her? 
I certainly have. She was a scientist years ago. 
That's right. She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago, so we're celebrating 
her centenary. 
I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her. I didn't realise she came from 
Kenton. 
Yes. Well, all that will take place in the afternoon, and later. as the sun sets. there'll Q5 
be a firework display. You should go to the park to watch. as you'll get the best view 
from there. and the display takes place on the opposite side of the river. It's always

There are several events that go on the whole time. For example, the students of 
the art college have produced a number of videos. all connected with relationships 
between children and their grandparents. 
WOMAN: That sounds interesting. It makes a change from children and parents, doesn't it! 
Exactly. Because the art college is in use for classes, throughout the festival, the 
videos are being shown in Handsworth House.

Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I'll bring you up to date 
with what I know. 
As you know, we're flying firstto. Munich, on Monday the 4th .
The flight is a t 11.30, so it's too early to have lunch at the airport. I suggest we meet there for 011
coffee at 10, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home. 
When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour Q12
operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany. He's already liaised with 
the managers of the theatres we're going to visit, and he's also arranged for an officer of the 
National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay. 
Now last time we discussed this trip, I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now 
I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double 
room. I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros. but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate 
o f 110. That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this 
week. 

013 

On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of 
the theatres, but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange, so instead we'll have a 
· coach trip to one of the amazing·castles in the mountains south of Munich.

-

On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From
talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be
too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must
confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to
an Italian restaurant at home.

014 

On Wednesday afternoon. the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to Q15 
us a t the theatre. She'll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she
chose the actors, and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one. how she worked with
the playwright.

101 

Audioscripts 

Right. Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see, partly 
because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you! 

The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we're going to the 
premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don't have to dress 
formally. I gather it's rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a 
soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be 
able to attend. 

On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was 
commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist. 
We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest. 

Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it'll be in the 
garden of a palace. It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much 
protection from the wind. 

Q16 

Q17 

Q 18

On Saturday. we're going by coach to a theatre in another town. not far from Munich. This will Q19
be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will 
be attending. After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and 
there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region. 

And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday. and it's in the stunning 
setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14 th century: The performance marks the 
fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his 
first professional appearance, all those years ago. 

Q20 

And the day after that, we'll be flying back home. Now have you got any questions before I ... 

SECTION 3 

Oh good morning. You must be James. I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth. 
Thank you. 
Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies 
course, I'd like to find out something about you. Why did you decide to take this 
course? 
Wel l. my mother is Danish. and although we always lived in England, she used to 
talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit Denmark. We hardly ever 
did. though - my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or 
friends were in England they always came to see us. 
I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be 
studying. 
I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate. 
Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad. Have 
you had any thoughts about that? 
I'm really looking forward to it. And although Denmark seems the obvious place to 
go, because of my family connections, I'd love to spend the time in Iceland. 
Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged. Do you have any plans for when you graduate? A lot 
o f students go on to take a master's degree. 
I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I'm 
interested in journalism. and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing 
for magazines. I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most 
graduates do.

moment will be replaced by more specialised courses. Oh, and by the way, if you're 
interested in watching Danish television programmes - there's going to be a course 
on that the term after next. 
JAMES: That sounds good. 
Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next 
few weeks? 
JAMES: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas. 
Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be 
difficult to get hold of the books you'll need. Why not leave that for another time? 
JAMES: Right. 
You might find modern novels or 19 th century playwrights interesting. 
I've read o r seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea. 
Fine. I'll put you down for that topic. 
JAMES: Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper? 
First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail. That 
approach certainly has its place, but I think you first need to get an understanding 
of the literature in the context of the society in which i t was produced - who it was 
written for, how it was published, and so on. I also think that's more fruitful than 
placing it within the history of the genre.

Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the

Of course. Have you decided yet what to write about? 
No, I haven't. There's so much that seems interesting - Viking settlement in other 
countries, trade, mythology ... 
Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which 
is kept in the library. It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find i t helpful. I'll 
give you the details in a moment. Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be 
very difficult to choose just one. 
OK. I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year. 
Should I watch that again? 
If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it - it's more fantasy than reality. 
But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch. It makes some 
interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic. 
Right·· --
So then should I work out an outline? 
Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage. And then you should start 
looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise 
according to those headings. 
I see. 
Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading. Make 
sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper 
in full. 
OK. Thanks, that's very helpful.

SECTION 4 

Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably. After all, there was a 
time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions. Conditions have 
improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common. And human resources managers 
nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary. 

What is conflict in the workplace? Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range 
of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to - at the 
opposite extreme - physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying, by which 
I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a 
weaker position. Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be 
described in these terms. 

Q31 

As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it. But often it's caused by 
someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else, in order to feel that 
they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people. 

Q32 

In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the personality o f one Q33 
is in some way incompatible with that of the other person. A general habit of optimism in one 
person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic - not that that 
justifies treating them badly, of course. 

Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their 
team than in the company as a whole. These conflicts are called 'structural', and could come 
about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who 
do any useful work, and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators. 

Q34 

Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned - the situation is likely to be very stressful Q35 
for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months. For the company, if no 
effort is made to deal with conflict, it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown 
of the business. 

Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs - has uncovered some of the reasons 
why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics: 
confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable o f great achievements - with a high level 
o f anxiety, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves o r by the directors of the 
company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their 
decisions. 

In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic. And it's 
particularly difficult to tackle the situation where colleagues, managers and board members 
are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can't agree on strategic issues and on 
where they see the business going. there are real problems. 

Q36 

Q37 

For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an autocratic form 
of management - where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -
would see more conflict than others. Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic Q38 
business model. can suffer 
when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting 
demands. 

more. 

Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects. Of course 
the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place. A good manager, at any level. will make 
efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with, particularly those who report to them. 
That will involve politeness in all communications, and treating them as equals who happen 
to have a different role within the organisation. 

Q39 

104 

Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand. In such cases the human 
resources department often gets involved. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees 
human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive, then an external mediator 
might be able to help. By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been 
happening, they can build a clear picture of the situation, and give feedback that both sides 
will accept, precisely because they're independent.

Q10 

SECTION 2 

In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays 
we offer at BC Travel. Now, the travel business is very competitive and it's important to be 
aware of how the market's changing and developing. In terms of age groups, the over -65s are 
an important market, and one that's increasing steadily year on year. The fewest holidays are 
taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds , and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at 
present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group's also seen the biggest drop 
over the last few years, whereas there 's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken 
by the 55 to 64-year-olds. As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned , bookings there are 
steady, but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected. 

Q11 & 
Q12 

Q11 & 
Q12 

One trend we 're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays 
in which clients do some kind of spec ialised activity. I'm not talking here about adventure 
holidays , where clients take part in high - risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill 
of it. Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music. 
They 're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite , in fact. But they 
do often take place outside the main tourist centres. which gives an opportunity for clients 
to find out more about the local people and customs, and many say this is one of the most 
positive features of these holidays . Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or 

Q13 & 
Q14 

106 

Test 7 

talent, but clients often say that more than this. it's the chance to create lasting relationships 
with other like-minded people that's the main draw. 

013 & 
014 

Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays. Our painting holidays take 
place in four different centres in France and Italy and they're very popular with clients of all 
abilities from beginners onwards. We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -
some of them have been with us from the start. and five addit ional ones will be joining us this 
year so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre. 

As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients 
cook recipes related to one particular country, usually the one they 're staying in. but we focus 
on dishes from a great many different ones. Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis 
on good quality, organic ingredients - that's more or less a given nowadays - and there are 
generally some meat-free recipes included. 

Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, 
and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery . Groups are small, no more 
than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday. and excursions are 
arranged with fully-trained guides . At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the 
photographs taken so that clients can see one another 's work and receive valuable feedback 
from the tutor. 

015 

016 

017 

Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays. In rrel'and and Italy we run ohe-week 
general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness .. Clients start the course with a 
consultation with a trainer, and together the y draw up an individual programme . As well as 
improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built O 18 
up in their daily lives. 

In Greece. we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their 
we ight. This has all the features you 'd expect, like a personalised diet programme, but one 
of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. People say 
it's far preferable to being in a gym. 

Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the mountain biking 
holiday. Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability. We 
offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular . 

OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so thank you very much ... 

_ NATALIE : Dave, I'm worried about our case study, rve done a bit of reading, but I'm not sure 
what's involved in actually writing a case study - I missed the lecture where Dr 
Baker talked us through it. 
OK, well it's quite straightforward . We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton 
Castle site. And you said you'd done some reading about it. 
NATALIE: Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points. 
Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? 
NATALIE: Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that. 
OK , so we can compare what we've read . Then we have to decide on a particular 
problem or need at our site . And then think about who we 're going to interview to get 
more information.

NATALIE: OK. So who'd that be? The people who work there? And presumably some of the 
tourists too? 
Yes, both those groups. So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose . But we 
might also do some of our interviewing away from the site - we cou ld even contact 
some people here in the city. l ike administrators involved in overseein g tour ism . 
NATALIE: OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and fix times and places for 
the meetings. It's all going to take a lot of time. 
Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some 
numerical data that we can add to support our findings. 
NATALIE : And photographs? 
I think we have plenty of those already. But Dr Baker also sa id we have to establish 
with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study. or whether 
they want to be anonymous . 
NATALIE : Oh, I wouldn 't have thought of that. OK , once we 've got al l this information, 
I suppose we have to analyse it. 
Yes, put it a ll together and choose what's relevant to th e problem we 're focusing 
on, and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identi fy any tre nds or regularities 
there . That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots 
of facts. 
NATA LIE : OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next? 
DAVE: Well , then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected to make 
it as clear as possible to our readers. Things like grc;1phs, or tables, or charts ... 

DAVE: 

DAVE: 

NATALIE: Right. 
DAVE: 

Then the case study itse lf is mostly quite standard ; we begin by presenting the 
problem, and giving some background, then go through t he main sections , but th e 
thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we 'd end with some suggestions 
to deal with the problem or need we identified. but in a case study we end up with a 
question or a series of questions to our readers. and th ey decide wh at o ught to be 
done. 
NATALIE: Oh , I had n 't realised that. 

DAVE: 

NATALIE : So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Ho rton Castle 
site is why so few tourists are vi sit ing it. And we 'll find out more from our interv iews, 
but I d id find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be 
because as far as transpo rt goes, access is d ifficu lt. 
I read that too , but th at report wa s ac tually writt e n ten yea rs ago, wh en th e road 
there was rea lly bad, but that's been improved now. And I th ink there's plenty of 
fascinating stuff there for a rea lly good day out. but you 'd never rea lise it from the 
castl e website - maybe that's the problem . 
NATALIE : Yes, it's rea lly dry and boring. 
I read somewh e re a suggest ion that wh at the castle needs is a visitor ce ntre. So w e 
could have a look for some inform ation abo ut that on the internet. What would we 
need to know? 
NATALI E: Well , who 'd use it for a start . It'd be good to know wh at categor ies the visitors fell 
into too, like school pa rties o r retired people, but I think we'd have to ta lk to staff to 
get that inform ation . 
OK . And as we're thinking of suggesting a v is itor ce ntre w e'd also have to look at 
potential problems . I mean, obvious ly it wouldn't be cheap to set up. 
NATALI E: No , but it cou ld be a really good investment. And as it's on a histor ica l site it'd need 
to get spec ia l planning permission. I expect. Th at might be hard .

Right , especially as the only possible place for it would be at t he entrance , and th at's

NATALIE : Mmm . 
DAVE: 

But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton. At present it's a bit of a ghos t 
town. Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifi cations, the young people 
all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the only people left are 
children and those who 've retired. 
NATALIE : Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that 
tourists m ight cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact. At present 
the tourists can just wander round wherever they want, but if numbers increase , 
there might have to be some restrictions, l ike stic k ing to marked ways. And the re 'd 
need to be guides and wa rdens around to make sure these were enforced. 
Yes, we could look at that too. OK , well .. .

OK , so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife . 
Now I'll discuss a particular examp le. Let's take a look at me rcury. Mercury 's one of the 120 or 
so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbo l Hg. It's a shiny , s ilvery subs tance . 
You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it's not used much for domestic 
purposes now because it's highly tox ic . 

But the problem is that the arnount of merc u ry in the environme nt's increas ing. Th e main 
reaso n fo r t his is the power plants used to prod uce e lect ricity . T he ma in so urce of energy tha t 
m ost of t hem use is st ill coal, and w hen it's burned it releases mercu ry into t he atm os phere. 
Some of this gets deposi ted into lakes and rivers, and if it's ingested by a fish it's not 
ex c rete d , it sta ys in the fis h's body a nd it enters t he food ch ai n . So it's bee n known for some 
time th at b irds w hic h eat fish may be affected, but w hat wa s n't know n until quite recent ly is 
that those that eat insects can also be affected . 

So a woman called C laire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting 
birds . 

And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by merc ury poison ing , she 's 
looking for more subtle sub-effects . And these may be to do w ith the behaviou r of the birds, 
or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems 
with memory, for examp le . And she 's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on 
bird song. Now . the process of song learning happens at a part icular stage in the birds' 
development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by 
·listening to the songs produced by ' its ·father,-rather than by ,any othe r bird. ··· · 

031 

032 

033 

And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male b irds are expose d to 034 
. mercury, if they"eat food contam inate·d with inercuiy, ·then . the so ngs fh-ey-produce -a ren'fEis· -· 
complex as those prod uced by other birds . So quite low-leve l exposure to mercury is l ike ly 
to have an impact on male birds in a nat ural situation , because it can mean that they 're less 
attract ive to female birds , and so it can affect their chances of reproduct ion . 

03 5 

Now the way she's carryi ng out this research is worth thinking about. She 's using a mixt ure 
of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carr ied out outdoo rs in the wild. T he 
lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a 
natural setting, so the experimenter has a much higher level of control, and that means they 
can be more confident about their results in some ways . And of course they don 't have to 
worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them . 

036 

109 

Audioscripts 

So what are the implications here for humans? Well , because many birds are migratory, they Q37 
may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites . For example, it's been found that 
ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters ove r a thousand 
kilometres away, and presumably eaten. But these birds likely had mercury levels high 
enough to warrant concern for human consumption. 

In addit ion, going back to song learning by birds , we saw that this may be affected by 
mercury contamination. Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental 
delays in the acquisition of language, and in fact this process is very similar in the brain 
regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But mercury contamination has 
other important implications for humans as well. It's now known that an unborn child can be 
affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury, and these effects can 
be quite substantial. 

In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing 
or environmental wellbeing. It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from 
power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for 
everyone . Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wild life. But as we 've seen , the 
issues go beyond that , and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully .

Hello , Pembroke Cycling Holidays, Bob speaking. 
Oh hello. I've seen your advert for people to lead cycle trip s. Are you the right 
person to speak to? 
Yes , I am. Could I have your name , please? 
It's Margaret Smith. 
Are you looking for a permanent job, Margaret? 
No, temporary. I've got a permanent job starting in a few months ' time, and I 
want to do something else until then. 
What work do you do? 
This will probably sound crazy - I used to be a lawyer, and then I made a 
complete career change and I'm going to be a doctor . I've just finished my 
tra ining. 
Right. And have you had any experience of leading cycle tr ips? 
Yes, I've led several bike tours in Africa. The trip to India that I had arranged to 
lead next month has now been cancelled, so when I saw you were advert ising 
for tour leaders , I decided to apply . 
OK. Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size 
of the group. Some tours are for very experienced cyclists , but we've got a tour 
coming up soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional 
leader . It's a cycling holiday for families . Would that suit you? 
It certainly would. I enjoy working with children, and I probably need some more 
experience before I go on a really challenging trip. 
That tour includes several teenagers : have you worked with that age group 
before? 
Yes, I'm a volunteer worker in a youth club, where I help people to improve their 
cycling skills . Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.

W~Jc_ome ta. this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city, 
As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep , 
but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing , vibrant area of the city, which is also home to 
one of the city 's fastest-growing communities. The nearby university has always meant the 
area's popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates 
embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments 
recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live . 

The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures. jewellery and 
ceramics which won't break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables . 
There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all

over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the 
city 's first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today . 

The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there's a policy of encouraging new young 
designers. The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate 
about fashion. This year they 've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from th e 
music and technology that's part of their everyday l ife, using both natural and man-made 
fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers, and the 
winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening. 

Q13 

Parking at the Sheepmarket 
is easy. There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces 
on the roadsides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want 
to spend the day there it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It's not 
expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores. you 'll not be charged Q14 
at all. After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very 
reasonable. 

The Sheepmarket 
is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country. 
If you look at our map, you ' ll see some of the main attractions there . Most visitors start from 
Crawley Road , at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in Q15 
the city. and is open to the public. It's on the north side of Crawley Road. next to the footpath 
that leads to the public gardens. 

The area 's particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures . The Thumb' is1ust what ~ts name Q16 
suggests. but it's about 10 metres high . You'll see it on Hill Road. across the road froni the 
Bank . 

The Museum 's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes. It's on the east 
side of the Sheepmarket. on City Road. It's on the other side of the road from the pub lic 
gardens. immediately facing the junction with Hill Road. 

Q17 

The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off St ation Square. not far fr om the Q18 
public gardens. The road ends at th e gallery - it doesn't go anywhere else. That's open eve ry 
day except Mondays . 

The W a rner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art. It's on City Ro ad . near the junction with 
Crawley Road. on th e same side of the road as th e public gardens. It's op e n on w ee kdays 
from 9 to 5 , and entry is free . 

Q19 

Finally. if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork. the place to go is Nucleus . You Q2O 
ne ed to go from Cr awley Road up through Sta tion Square and east along Hill Road until you 
get to a small winding road turning off . Go up there and it's on your right - if you get to City 
Road you've gone too far.

JOE: 

KATIE: So I thought I'd start with Giannetti, who's a professor of film and literature, and in one 021 
of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations based 
on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels . 
Right. 
I've already made some notes on that, so I just need to sort those out before the 
presentation. I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the worst examples 
of Shakespeare adaptations that they've seen, and to say why. That should be more 
fun than having their favourite versions. 
Yes, I ca n certainly think of a couple! 
KATIE: Right. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow . I came across something on the 
internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film 
clips to illustrate her ideas. 
JOE: Will you have enough time , though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? 
After all , I doubt if you'll be able to find all the cl ips you want. 
KATIE: Hmm. Perhaps you're right. OK, well, I'd better do some slides instead, saying how 
various films relate to what she says. That should encourage discussion. 
JOE : Mmm . 
KATIE : Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because 024 
they're concerned with issues of the time when the film is made.

approac hes , and make some comments on them . Do you know the Japanes e filni 
Ran? 
I haven' t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare 's King Lear , wasn 't it? 
KATIE: That's right. It was a very loose adaptat ion. using the same situation and sto ry, but 
moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain. So for example t he 
king 's daughters become sons, because in Japanese cu lture at that time, women 
couldn't succeed to the throne. 
JOE: OK. I hope you're going to talk about the1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think 
that's one of the best Shakespeare films . It really brings the play to life , doesn't it? 
KATIE: Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what 
life was like at the time of the play. 
JOE : Absolutely . Right, what's next? 
KATIE: Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet , the 1996 film, which moves the action into the 
present day. 
JOE : Yes, it worked really well , I thought - changing the two feuding families in the original 
to two competing business empires, even though they're speaking in the English of the 
original play. 
KATIE : YoLJ'd ~xp~ct it would sound really b_izarre, but I found I soon got used to it. . 
JOE: Me too. 
KATIE : Then I thought I'd include a real Hollywood film , one that's intended to appeal to a 
mass commercial audience. 
There must be quite a number of those. 
KATIE: Yes, but I've picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but 
it's more like a typical action hero movie - there are loads of special effects, but no 
unifying interpretation of the play. 
JO E : All show and no substance. 
KATIE: Exactly. Then there's Prospero 's Books, based on The Tempest. That was really 
innovative, from a stylistic point of view .

No. but I've read about it. It was a blend of a documen tary with a few scenes from 
Richard Ill, wasn 't it? 
KATIE : That's right. It's more a way of looking into how people nowadays conne ct wi th the 
playwright - the play is really just th e starting point. And tha t' l l be where I finish .

SECTION 4 

This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, t he study of sound , in relation to urban 
environments such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself , I think this is an area where 
we're likely to see great changes . In the past , researching urban sounds capes was simple . 
We measured levels of sound in decibels , so I used to take my sound meter and I measured 
the noise somewhere , and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sou nd 
became annoying . 

With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up wha t we call no ise maps , 
maps of the sound environment. But actually these aren't a lot of use . What the y do show is 
that the highest noise levels are generally on roads - well, that's not really ver y surpr ising . 
But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don 't show , because they can 't captur e 
the complex way that sound varies over time . So they ignore important issues such as the 
noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours , and th is 
sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don't have any databases on this sort 
of information . As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact 
that people vary in their perceptions of no ise - so someone like me with years of wor k ing in 
acoust ics might be very different from you in that regard . 

0 3 1 

But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude, they 've been usefu l in providi ng 
information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it's a 
political matter. And that's important - we need rules and regulations because noise can 
cause all sorts of problems. 

0 32 

Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so c ity-dwe llers 
often suffer from interrupted sleep . It's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of 
stress , due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood. A nd there 
are other problems as well, for instance if schoolchildren don 't have a qu iet place to study . 
their work will suffer. 

Now , one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn 't differentiate between different 
types of noise. Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and 
relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels - think of the sound made by a fountain 
in a town square, for example . That's not necessarily something that we 'd want to contro l o r 
reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design . This is 
going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn 't going to help us here . Instead, 
many researchers are using social science techniques, studying people 's emotional response 
to sound by using questionnaires and so on. 

03 3 

0 34 

035 

So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent 
interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradi ctory - Q._ 036 
city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of 
high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee mach ine, but these mustn 't be too intrusive. 
because at the same time we need to be able to relax. 

114 

One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to 
use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very 
little training in this area. But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add 
to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they tend to see it as something to be 
avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that's just a job for engineers like the 
street drainage system. 

TestB 

037 

What's needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something 
that has the qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to 
know what governs it and how designers can work with it. We need to develop a complex 
understanding of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? What 
can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with 
human development and social relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and 
feelings? Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself? 

Today's powerful technologies can also help us . To show us their ideas and help us to 
imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual 
reality- but these programs are silent. In the future such programs could use realistic 
sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using 
the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the 
ears as well as the eyes.

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate covers the key features and rounds off the description with an 
overview. Organisation is evident, however not wholly logical, and it is sometimes 
difficult to relate data to specific age groups. Vocabulary is just about adequate, 
but is rather dependent on input material [regular physical activity I percentage]: 
original material is limited to e.g. [teenager I mid-twenties] with a lot of inaccuracy 
in word formation. Most sentence forms consist of simple structures and these 
are often inaccurate [bars's changed and interesting I men's percentage are 
increasing I the percentage more decrease unti�, though there is some accuracy in 
comparative forms [is higher than].

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate addresses all parts of the prompt, although there is some 
misunderstanding of the term shared freely. Ideas relating to each sector 
mentioned in the prompt are presented, yet there is not much development of 
these, especially of sharing ideas in the business world. There is a clear overall 
progression, with the candidate's own opinion presented at the end, but there 
are some errors in the use of cohesive devices [working there on out of this I 
which scientist]. Lexis is mainly appropriate for the task, though there are some 
errors in word choice [actual I releases] and spelling [govenment I limite I 
theme I loose]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, with a fair 
degree of accuracy: errors in grammatical control seldom prevent meaning from 
coming through.

TEST 6, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written 
by a candidate 
who achieved 
a Band 7.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's 
comment: 

The candidate 
covers all the key features 
and presents 
a clear overview 
of the 
developments 
planned. 
Information 
and ideas are logically 
organised 
and there is 
a clear progression 
throughout 
the response. 
A range of cohesive 
devices 
is used 
flexibly 
[currently 
I Overall I First of all I therefore I Moreover I The next point I To 
sum up]. Lexical 
choice shows flexibility 
and precision, 
and includes 
less common 
items [modifications 
I predicting 
I grouped in a shopping 
main, though there is some 
inappropriate 
word choice [desetves]. 
A range of grammatical 
structures 
is used 
flexibly 
and accurately 
and error-free 
sentences 
are frequent.

TEST 6, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The response looks at some advantages and disadvantages of the topic, but 
does not reach any conclusion. As a result, there is a lack of overall progression, 
although organisation is evident and cohesive devices are used (though rather 
mechanically) [One of advantages I For example I A/so I Another disadvantage I 
For instance]. The range of lexis is adequate for the task, however there are often 
spelling mistakes [contries I yonge I quilifiedj and errors in word choice or formation 
[chancing to improve I unemployee problem]. There are attempts to produce 
complex sentence forms, but there is a lack of grammatical control which can 
cause some difficulty for the reader [ ... due to some countries limit the population, if 
that have more young children it will over limit].

TEST 7, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate organises the information well and describes the trends in the 
various groups, but the lack of data to support the descriptions is a significant 
omission. There is a clear progression throughout the response, with good 
management of cohesive devices [percentage of people who I during the same 
period I in these segments o f the chart I the groups in which I such facilities]. Lexis 
shows some flexibility and precision [on a weekly basis] and there is evidence of 
less common items [segments I major changes I most of the population I most/ 
least popular I with the exception 
with few errors in word choice [visualises I be 
I clients]. There is a variety of complex structures used with flexibility and accuracy, 
but there are also a few errors in grammatical control and in punctuation.

TEST 7, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 7.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is a good response which would achieve an even higher score if there was 
more focus on large sums of money and on between cities. The writing is well 
organised and there is a clear progression throughout, although the use of some 
cohesive devices could be more flexible. There is a wide range of vocabulary, 
used appropriately and naturally, [preferred method of transporlation I leave the 
driving to the professional I more affordable I ever-expanding urban populations I 
embrace the idea of], but some spelling errors are noted [Communters I whi// I cheif 
I ammount I busses]. There is a wide range of structures and again, these are used 
flexibly, however there are occasional errors in punctuation.

TEST 8, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate has provided a clear introduction and an overview of the key 
stages of the process. Each stage is identified and described, although there are 
some minor errors in the reporting of stage 5. There is room for expansion of the 
description of each stage, which could help to achieve a higher score. There is a 
clear overall progression, with each stage being signalled by appropriate markers 
[First I in order to I After that I At this point I Then, the final step I Finally]. These 
markers are adequate, but a higher score might be achieved by varying their 
position in each sentence, rather than always placing them at the beginning. The 
range of vocabulary is adequate for the task and there are attempts to use more 
variety here [five general steps I connected I accumulated], though there are 
some examples of error in word choice .[box I tank I a circle movements I a circular 
movement], in spelling [undergrownd I trough I conteiner I sumary] and in word 
formation [condensered I condensed I gas I gaseous I :trasladated I transferred? I 
condensering I condensing]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, 
including accurate use of passive forms. There are some errors [a/ an I who I 
what], but otherwise the level of accuracy is good. The same level of accuracy, over 
a wider range of sentence forms, would increase the score on Grammatical Range 
and Accuracy.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is an attempt to address the prompt and some main ideas are put forward, 
but there is no discussion of is likely to result in a society of individuals who 
only think about their own wishes. This omission, and the fact that the response 
is underlength, limit the Band score rating. Organisation is evident, however the 
answer lacks contextualisation, and cohesion within sentences is sometimes 
faulty [that is cause many African children to ... I they will show respect to their 
ad community in is genera�. Vocabulary is the strongest aspect of the response 
[confident I make mistakes I dictate I the right path I do something wrong I manage 
their affairs I vandals and aggressors I determine their own choices I show respect 
I oppressed I respect children I justify] and although spelling errors occur, they do 
not generally prevent meaning from coming through [becouse I fought I smagging]. 
Grammatical control is variabl.e: some complex structures are produced accurately 
while other, simpler, forms contain errors. Punctuation and capitalisation are also 
sometimes faulty.

Introduction

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is widely recognised as 
a reliable means of assessing the language ability of candidates who need to study 
or work where English is the language of communication. These Practice Tests are 
designed to give future IELTS candidates an idea of whether their English is at the 
required level.
IELTS is owned by three partners, Cambridge English Language Assessment, part of 
the University of Cambridge, the British Council and IDP Education Pty Limited (through 
its subsidiary company, IELTS Australia Pty Limited). Further information on IELTS can 
be found on the IELTS website www.ielts.org.

WHAT IS THE TEST FORMAT?

IELTS consists of four components. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking 
tests. There is a choice of Reading and Writing tests according to whether a candidate is 
taking the Academic or General Training module.

Academic
For candidates wishing to study at 
undergraduate or postgraduate levels, 
and for those seeking professional 
registration.

General Training
For candidates wishing to migrate to an 
English-speaking country (Australia, Canada, 
New Zealand, UK), and for those wishing to 
train or study at below degree level.

The test components are taken in the following order:

Listening
4 sections, 40 items, approximately 30 minutes

Academic Reading 
3 sections, 40 items
60 minutes

Academic Writing

Introduction 

ACADEMIC TEST FORMAT 

Listening 

This test consists 
of four sections, 
each with ten questions. 
The first 
two sections 
are 
concerned 
with social 
needs. The first 
section 
is a conversation 
between two speakers 
and 
the second section 
is a monologue. 
The final two sections 
are concerned 
with situations 
related 
to educational 
or training 
contexts. 
The third section 
is a conversation

Introduction 

Speaking 

This test takes between 11 and 14 minutes 
and is conducted 
by a trained 
examiner. 
There are three parts: 

Part 1 

The candidate 
and the examiner 
introduce 
themselves. 
Candidates 
then answer general 
questions 
about themselves, 
their home/family, 
their job/studies, 
their interests 
and a wide 
range of similar 
familiar 
topic areas. This part lasts between four and five minutes. 

Part 2 

The candidate 
is given a task card with prompts 
and is asked to talk on a particular 
topic. 
The candidate 
has one minute to prepare 
and they can make some notes if they wish, 
before speaking 
for between one and two minutes. 
The examiner 
then asks one or two 
questions 
on the same topic. 

Part 3 

The examiner 
and the candidate 
engage in a discussion 
of more abstract 
issues which are 
thematically 
linked 
to the topic in Part 2. The discussion 
lasts between four and five minutes. 

The Speaking 
test assesses 
whether 
candidates 
can communicate

Introduction 

HOW IS IELTS SCORED? 

IELTS results are reported on a nine-band scale. In addition to the score for ove rall language 
ability, IELTS provides a score in the form of a profile for each of the four skills (Listening, 
Reading , Writing and Speaking). These scores are also reported on a nine-band scale. Al l 
scores are recorded on the Test Report Form along with details of the candidate's nationality , 
first language and date of birth. Each Overall Band Score corresponds to a descriptive 
statement which gives a summary of the English language ability of a candidate classified at 
that level. The nine bands and their descriptive statements are as follows : 

9 Expert User - Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate , accurate and 
fluent with complete understanding. 

8 Very Good User - Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional 
unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in 
unfamiliar situations . Handles complex detailed argumentation well. 

7 Good User - Has operational command of the language, though with occasional 
inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally 
handles complex language weJI and understands detailed reasoning . 

6 Competen t User - Has generally effective command of the language despit e some 
inaccu racies, inapprop riacies and misunder s tandings. Can use and unde rs tand fairly 
compl ex language , part ic ula rly in famili ar si tuat ions. 

5 Modest User - Has partial command of the language , coping with overall meaning in 
most situations , though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic 
communicat ion in own field. 

4 Limited User - Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems 
in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language. 

3 Extremely Limited User - Conveys and understands only general meaning in very 
familiar situations. Frequen t breakdowns in communication occur. 

2 Intermittent User - No real communication is possible except for the most basic 
information using isol ated words .or short formulae in familiar situations and to meJ~t 
immediate needs . Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English . 

1 Non User - Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated 
words. 

0 Did not attempt the test- No assessable inform a tion p rovid ed.

Introduction 

MARKING THE PRACTICE TESTS 

Listening and Reading 

The Answer Keys are on pages 116-123 . 
Each question in the Listening and Reading tests is worth one mark . 

Questions which require letter I Roman numeral answers 

• For questions where the answers are letters or Roman numerals, you should write only 
the number of answers required. For example, if the answer is a single letter or numeral 
you should write only one answer. If you have written more letters or numerals than are 
required, the answer must be marked wrong. 

Questions which require answers in the form of words or numbers 

• Answers may be written in upper or lower case . 
• Words in brackets are optional - they are correct, but not necessary . 
• Alternative answers are separated by a slash (/). 
• 
If you are asked to write an answer using a certain number of words and/or (a) 
number(s), you will be penalised if you exceed this. For example, if a question specifies 
an answer using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS and the correct answer is 'black 
leather coat', the answer 'coat of black leather ' is incorrect. 
In questions where you are expected to complete a gap, you should only transfer the 
necessary missing word(s) onto the answer sheet. For example, to complete 'in the ... ', 
where the correct answer is 'morning', the answer 'in the morning' would be incorrect. 
• All answers require correct spelling (including words in brackets) . 
• Both US and UK spelling are acceptable and are included in the Answer Key. 
• All standard alternatives for numbers, dates and currencies are acceptable. 
• All standard abbreviations are acceptable. 
• You will find additional notes about individual answers in the Answer Key . 

• 

Writing 

The sample answers are on pages 124-131. It is not possible for you to give yourself a mark 
for the Writing tasks. We have provided sample answers (written by candidates), showing 
their score and the examiner's comments. These sample answers will give you an insight 
into what is required for the Writing test.

Introduction 

HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES? 

At the end of each Listening and Reading Answer Key you will find a chart which will help 
you assess whether, on the basis of your Practice Test results, you are ready to take the 
IELTS test. 
In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind. Your 
performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band Score 
from 1 to 9 for each of the components and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which 
is the average of your scores in the four components . However, institutions considering 
your application are advised to look at both the Overall Band Score and the Bands for 
each component in order to determine whether you have the language skills needed for a 
particular course of study. For example, if your course involves a lot of reading and writing, 
but no lectures, listening skills might be less important and a score of 5 in Listening might be 
acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a course which has lots of lectures 
and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening might be unacceptable even though the 
Overall Band Score was 7 . 
Once you have marked your tests, you should have some idea of whether your listening 
and reading skills are good enough for you to try the IELTS test. If you did well enough in 
. one component, but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are ready 
to take the test. 
The Practice Tests have been checked to ensure that they are of approximately the same 
level of difficulty as the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the 
Practice Tests will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you 
an idea of your poss ible future performance and it is u ltimately up to you to make decisions 
based on your score. 
Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have 
based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept. 
The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score than 
most other institutions.

READING PASSAGE 

1 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13 , which are based on Reading 
Passage 1 below. 

Cork 

Cork - the thick bark of the cork oak 
tree (Quercus suber) - is a remarkable 
material. It is tough, elastic, buoyant , 
and fire-resistant, and su itab le for a 
wide range of purposes. It has a lso 
been us ed for millen ni a: th e anci ent 
Egyptians sealed their sa rcopha gi 
(stone coffins) with cork, while the 
ancient Greeks and Romans used it 
for anything from beehives to sandals. 

And the cork oak itself is an 
extraordinary tree. Its bark grows 
up to 20 cm in thickness, insulating 
the tree like a coat wrapped around 
the tr unk and br anches and keeping 
th e inside at a constant 20°C all year 
round. Developed most probably as 
a defence against forest fires, th e 
bark of the cork oak has a particular 
cellular structure - with about 
40 million cells per cubic centimetre -
that technology has nev er succeeded 
in re plicatin g . Th e cells are filled with 
air, which is why cork is so buoyant. 
It also has an elasticity that means 
you can squash it and watch it spring 
back to its original size and shape 
when you release the pressure. 

Cork oaks grow in a number of 
Mediterranean countries, including 

Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and 
Morocco. They flourish in warm, sunny 
climates wher e there is a minimum of 
400 millimetres of rain per year, and 
not more than 800 millimetres. Like 
grape vines, th e tre es thrive in poor 
soil, putting down deep roots in search 
of moisture and nutrients. Southern 
Portugal's Alen tejo region m eet s all of 
these requirements, wh ich explains 
why, by the early 20th century, this 
region had become the wor ld 's largest 
producer of cork, and why today it 
accounts for roughly half of all cork 
production around the world. 

Most cork forests are famil y-owned. 
Many of these family businesses , and 
ind eed many of the trees the1nsel ve s, 
are around 200 years old. Cork 
production is , above all, an exercise in 
patience. From the planting of a cork 
sapling to the first harvest takes 25 
years, and a gap of approximately a 
decade must separate harvests from 
an individual tree . And for top-quality 
cork, it's necessary to wait a further 
15 or 20 years . You even have to wait 
for the right kind of summer's da y to 
harvest cork. If the bark is stripped on 
a da y when it's too cold - or when the 
air is damp - the tree will be damaged . 

16 

Reading 

Cork harvesting is a very specialised 
profession. No mechanical means 
of stripping cork bark has been 
invented, so the job is done by teams 
of highly skilled workers . First, they 
make vertical cuts down the bark 
using small sharp axes, then lever · 
it away in pieces as large as they 
can manage. The most skilful cork(cid:173)
strippers prise away a semi-circular 
husk that runs the length of the trunk 
from just above ground level to the 
first branches . It is then dried on the 
ground for about four months, before 
being taken to factories, where it is 
boiled to kill any insects that might 
remain in the cork. Over 60% of 
cork then goes on to be made into 
traditional bottle stopp ers, with m ost 
of the rem a inder being used in the 
constr uction trade . Corkboard an d 
cork t iles ar e id ea l for t hermal an d 
acous t ic insul at ion, wh ile gra nul es of 
cork are us ed in th e manufacture of 
concrete . 

Recent years have seen the end of 
the virtual monopoly of cork as the 
material for bottle stoppers, due to 
concerns about the effect it may have 
on the contents of the bottle . This 

is caused by a chemical compound 
called 2,4,6 -trichloroanisole (TCA), 
which forms through the interaction 
of plant phenols, chlorine and mould . 
The tiniest concentrations - as little 
as three or four parts to a trillion -
can spoil the taste of the product 
contained in the bottle. The result 
has been a gradual yet steady move 
first towards plastic stoppers and, 
more recently , to aluminium screw 
caps. These substitutes are ch eaper to 
manufacture and, in the case of screw 
caps, more convenient for the user . 

The classic cork stopper does 
have several advantages, however. 
Firstly, its traditional image is more 
in keeping with that of the typ e of 
high qualit y goods with which it has 
long b een a ss ociat ed. Secondly -
and very impo r tan t ly - cork is a 
su stain a ble p r odu ct th at can b e 
recy cled witho ut difficulty. Mor eover, 
cor k for es t s a re a resource which 
support local biodiversity, and preven t 
desertification in the regions where 
th ey are planted. So, given the current 
concerns about environmental issues, 
the future of this ancient material 
once again looks promising.

The cork oak has the thickest bark of any living tree. 

Scientists have developed a synthetic cork with the same cellular structure as 
natural cork. 

Individual cork oak trees must be left for 25 years between the first and second

operations, or the technical specifications 
of different engine types. 

Similarly, people who collect dolls may go 
beyond simply enlarging their collection, 
and deve lop an interest in the way that 
dolls are made, or the materials that 
are used. These have changed over the 
centuries from the wood that was standard 
in 16th century Europe, through the wax 
and porcelain of later centur ies, to the 
plastics of today's dolls. Or collectors 
might be inspired to study how dolls 
reflect notions of what children like, or 
ought to like. 

perhaps by country in alphabet ica l order, 
or grouping stamps by what they depict(cid:173)
people, birds, maps, and so on. 

One reason, conscious or not, for what 
someone chooses to collect is to show 
the collector's ind ividualism. Someone 
who decides to collect something as 
unexpected as dog collars, for instance, 
may be conveying their belief that they 
must be interesting themselves. And 
believe it or not, there is at least one dog 
collar museum in ex istence, and it grew out 
of a personal collection. 

Not all collectors are interested in learning 
from their hobby, t ho ugh, so wha t we 
might call a psychologica l reason for 
collecting 
is the need for a sense of 
control, perhaps as a way of dealing w ith 
insecurity. Stamp collectors, for instance, 
arrange their stamps in albums, usually very 
neatly, orga ni sing their co llect ion accord in g 
to certain commonp lac e pri ncip les -

Of course, all hobbies give pleasu re, but 
the common factor in collect in g is usually 
passion: pleasure is putting 
it far too 
mi ldly. More than most other hobb ies , 
co llec ting can be totally engrossing, 
and can give a strong sense of personal 
f ulfilment. To non-collec tors it may appear 
an eccen t ric, if harmless, way of spending 
time, but potentially, col lec t ing has a lot 
going for it.

Test5 

What's the purpose of gaining knowledge? 

A 

'I would found an institution where any person can find instruction 
in a ny 
subject.' That was the found er's motto for Cornell University, and it seems an apt 
characterization of the different university, also in rhe USA, where I currently teach 
philosophy. A student can prepare for a career in resort mana gem ent, engi neerin g, 
interior design, accounting, music, law enforc ement, yo u name it. But what would 
the founders of these two in st itution s have thought of a cou rse called 'Arson for Profit'? 
I kid you not: we have it on the books. Any undergr adu ates who have met the academic 
requirements ca n s ign up for the course in our program in 'fire science'. 

B Naturally, the co urse is int end ed for pro sp ective arson in vestigator s, who can learn all 
the tricks of th e trad e for d e tect ing whether a fire was deliberately set, di scove r ing who 
did it, and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law. 
But wouldn't this also b e the perfect course for pro spec tiv e a rso ni sts to sign up for? My 
point is not to criticize academic program s in fire science: they are hi ghly welcome as 
part of the increasii1g profe ssionaliz qtion of thi s and many other occupations. However, 
it 's not unknown for a firefighter to torch a building. 1his examp le su ggests how 
dishone st and illegal behavior, with th e help of. higher ed uc a tion , ca n creep into every 
aspect of publi c and busine ss life. 

C 

I realized this anew when I was invited to spea k before a class in m arketing, which is 
a noth er of our degree pro g rams. The regular in structor is a colleague who appreciates 
th e kind of et hi cal perspective I can brin g as a phil osop h er. There a re endless ways 
I cou ld hav e approac h ed this assignm e nt, but I took my cu e from th e titl e of the 
course: 'Prin c ipl es of Marketing '. It m ade me chink co ask the st udent s, 'ls m ark et in g 
princip led?' After a ll, a subj ect matter can have principles in the sense of being codified, 
havin g rules, as with football or chess, without being principl ed in the sense of being 
e thic al. Many of the students immediately assumed chat the answer co m y question 
ab out marketin g princip les was obvious : no. Just look at th e ways in whi ch every thing 
und er the sun h as b een mark eted; obviously it n eed not be do n e in a p rin cipled 
( =et hic al) fashion . 

D 

Is chat obvious? I mad e the sugges tion, which ma y sou nd downright cra zy in light of 
t h e ev iden ce, that perhaps marketing is by d efinition principled . My in sp ir at ion for this 
judgement 
is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that an y bod y of knowledge 
co n sists of an end (or purpos e) and a means . 

24 

Reading 

E Let us apply both the terms 'means' 
and 'end' to marketing. 
The students 
have signed 
up for a course 
in order to learn how to market effectively
. But to what encP. There seem 
to be two main attitudes 
toward that question. 
One is that the answer is obvious: 
the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is to sell things 
and to make money. The other attitude 
is that the 
purpose 
of marketing 
is irrelevant: 
Each person comes to the 
program 
and course 
with 
his or her own plans, 
and these need not even concern 
the acquisition 
of marketing 
expertise 
as such. My proposal, 
which I believe 
would also be Kane's, 
is that neither 
of 
these attitudes 
captures 
the significance of 
the end to the means for marketing. 
A field 
of knowledge 
or a professional 
endeavor 
is defined 
by both the means and the end; 
hence both deserve 
scrutiny. 
Students 
need to study both how to achieve 
X, and also 
what X is. 

F It is at this point that 'Arson 
for Profit' 
becomes 
supremely 
relevant. 
That course 
is 
presumably 
all about means: how to detect 
and prosecute criminal 
activity. 
It is therefore 
that the end is good in an ethical sense. 
assumed 
When I ask fire science 
students 
to 
articulate 
the end, or purpose, 
of their field, 
they eventually 
generalize 
to something 
like, 
'The safety 
and welfare of society,' which 
seems right. 
As we have seen, someone 
could 
use the very same knowledge 
of means to achieve 
a much less noble end, such as personal 
profit 
via destructive, 
dangerouS', 
reckless activity. 
But we would not call that fire.fightin
g. 
We have a separate 
word for it: arson. 
Similarly, 
if you. employed 
the 'principles 
of 
marketing' 
in an unprincipled 
way, you would not be doing marketing. We have another 
term for it: fraud. Kant gives the example 
of a doctor 
and a poisoner, 
who use the 
identical 
knowledge 
to achieve 
their divergent 
ends. We would say that one is practicing 
medicine, 
the other, 
murder.

READING PASSAGE 1 

You should spend about 20 minutes 
on Questions 
1-13, which are based on Reading 
Passage 1 below. 

The risks agriculture 
faces in developing 
countries 

Synthesis 
of an online 
debate* 

A Two things distinguish 
food production 
from all other productive 
activities: 
first, 
every single person needs food each day and has a right to it; and second, 
it is 
hugely dependent 
on nature. 
These two unique aspects, 
one political, 
the other 
natural, 
make food production 
highly 
vulnerable 
and different 
from any other 
business. 
At the same time, cultural 
values are highly entrenched 
in food and 
agricultural 
systems worldwide. 

B Farmers everywhere 
face major risks, 
including 
extreme weather, 
long-term 
climate 
change, and price volatility 
in input and product 
markets. 
However, 
smallholder 
farmers 
in developing 
countrie
s must in addition 
deal with adverse 
environments, 
both natural, 
in terms of soil quality, 
rainfall, 
etc., and human, in 
terms of infrastructure, 
financial 
systems, markets, 
knowledge 
and technology. 
Counter-intuitively, 
hunger is prevalent 
among many smallholder 
farmers 
in the 
developing 
world. 

C Participants 
in the online debate argued that our biggest 
challenge 
is to address the 
underlying 
causes of the agricultural 
system's 
inability 
to ensure sufficient 
food for 
all, and they identified 
as drivers 
of this problem our dependency 
on fossil 
fuels and 
unsupportive 
government 
policies. 

D On the question 
of mitigating 
the risks farmers 
face, most essayists 
called for 
greater 
state interventio
n. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President 
of the 
International 
Fund for Agricultural 
Development, 
argued that governments 
can 
significantly 
reduce risks for 
farmers 
by providing 
basic services like 
roads to get 
produce more efficiently 
to markets, 
or water and food 
storage facilities 
to reduce 
losses. 
Sophia Murphy, senior advisor 
to the Institute 
for Agriculture 
and Trade 
Policy, 
suggested 
that the procurement 
and holding 
of stocks by governments 
can also help mitigate 
wild swings in food prices by alleviating 
uncertainties 
about 
market supply. 

*The personal 
names in the text refer to the authors 
of written 
contributions 
to the online debate.

Reading 

E Shenggen 
Fan, Director 
General 
of the International 
Food Policy 
Research 
Institute, 
held up social 
safety 
nets and public 
welfare 
programmes 
in Ethiopia, 
Brazil 
and Mexico as valuable 
ways to address 
poverty 
among farming 
families 
and reduce their vulnerability 
to agriculture 
shocks. 
However, 
some commentators 
responded 
that cash transfers 
to poor families 
do not necessarily 
translate 
into 
increased 
food security, as these programmes 
do not always strengthen 
food 
production 
or raise incomes. 
Regarding 
state subsidies 
for agriculture, 
Rokeya 
Kabir, 
Executive 
Director 
of Bangladesh 
Nari Progati 
Sangha, 
commented 
in her 
essay that these 'have not compensated 
for the stranglehold 
exercised 
by private 
traders. 
In fact, studies 
show that sixty percent 
of beneficiaries 
of subsidies 
are not 
poor, but rich landowners 
and non-farmer 
traders.' 

F Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private 
risk management 
tools, 
like private 
insurance, 
commodity 
futures 
markets, 
and rural finance 
can help small-scale 
producers 
mitigate 
risk and allow for investment 
in improvements. 
Kabir warned 
that financial 
support 
schemes often encourage 
the adoption 
of high-input 
agricultural 
practices, 
which in the medium term may raise production 
costs 
beyond the value of their harvests. 
Murphy noted that when futures 
markets 
become excessively 
financialised 
they can contribute 
to short-term 
price volatility, 
which increases 
farmers' 
food insecurity. 
Many participants 
and commentators 
emphasised 
that greater 
transparency 
in markets 
is needed to mitigate 
the impact 
of volatil
ity, and make evident 
whether 
adequate 
stocks and supplies 
are available. 
Others contended 
that agribusiness 
companies 
should be held responsible 
for 
paying for negative 
side effects. 

G Many essayists 
mentioned 
climate 
change and its consequences 
for small-scale 
agriculture. 
Fan explained 
that 'in addition 
to reducing 
crop yields, 
climate 
change 
increases 
the magnitude 
and the frequency 
of extreme 
weather 
events, 
which 
increase 
smallholder 
vulnerabili
ty.' The growing 
unpredictability 
of weather 
patterns 
increases 
farmers' 
difficulty 
in managing 
weather-related 
risks. 
According 
to this 
author, 
one solution 
would be to develop 
crop varieties 
that are more resilient 
to new climate 
trends and extreme 
weather 
patterns. 
Accordingly, 
Pat Mooney, 
co-founder and executive 
director 
of the ETC Group, suggested 
that 'if we are to 
survive 
climate 
change, 
we must adopt policies 
that let peasants 
diversify 
the plant 
and animal species 
and varieties/breeds 
that make up our menus.'

H Some participating 
authors 
and commentators 
argued in favour of community­
based and autonomous 
risk management 
strategies 
through 
collective 
action 
groups, 
co-operatives 
or producers' 
groups. 
Such groups enhance market 
opportunities 
for small-scale 
producers, 
reduce marketing 
costs and synchronise 
buying and selling 
with seasonal 
price conditions. 
According 
to Murphy, 
'collective 
action 
offers 
an important 
way for farmers 
to strengthen 
their political 
and economic 
bargaining 
power, and to reduce their business 
risks.' 
One commentator, 
Giel Ton, 
warned that collective 
action 
does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort 
and money to organise, 
build trust and to experiment. 
Others, 
like Marcel Vernooij 
and Marcel Beukeboom, 
suggested 
that in order to 'apply 
what we already 
know', 
all stakeholders, 
including 
business, 
government, 
scientists 
and civil society, 
must 
work together, 
starting 
at the beginning of 
the value chain. 

Some participants 
explained 
that market price volatility 
is often worsened 
by the 
of intermediary 
purchasers 
who, taking 
advantage 
of farmers' 
vulnerability, 
presence 
dictate 
prices. 
One commentator 
suggested 
farmers 
can gain greater 
control 
over 
prices 
and minimise 
price volatility 
by selling 
directly 
to consumers. 
Similarly, 
Sonali 
Bisht, 
founder 
and advisor 
to the Institute 
of Himalayan Environmental 
Research 
and Education 
(INHERE), 
India, 
wrote that community-supported 
agriculture, 
where 
consumers 
invest 
i'n local 
farmers 
by subscription 
and guarantee 
producers 
a fair 
price, 
is a risk-sharing 
model worth more attention. 
Direct 
food distribution 
systems 
not only encourage 
small-scale 
agriculture 
but also give consumers 
more control 
over the food they consume, 
she wrote.

The Lost City 

An explorer's 
encounter 
with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, 
the most famous 
icon of the Inca civilisation 

A When the US explorer 
and academic 
Hiram Bingham arrived 
in South America 
in 
1911, he was ready for what was to be the greatest 
achievement 
of his life: 
the 
exploration 
of the remote hinterland 
to the west of Cusco, the old capital 
of the Inca 
empire in the Andes mountains 
of Peru. His goal was to locate 
the remains 
of a city 
called 
Vitcos, 
the last capital 
of the Inca civilisation. 
Cusco lies on a high plateau 
at an elevation 
of more than 3,000 metres, 
and Bingham's 
plan was to descend 
from this plateau 
along the valley 
of the Urubamba 
river, 
which takes a circuitous 
route down to the Amazon and passes through 
an area of dramatic 
canyons 
and 
mountain 
ranges. 

B When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba 
in late July, they had 
an advantage 
over travellers 
who had preceded 
them: a track had recently 
been 
blasted 
down the valley 
canyon to enable rubber to be brought 
up by mules from 
the jungle. 
Almost all previous 
traveUers 
had left the river atOllantaytambo 
and 
taken a high pass across the mountains 
'to rejoin 
the river lower down, thereby 
cutting 
a substantial 
corner, 
but also therefore 
never passing 
through 
the area 
around Machu Picchu. 

C On 24 July they were a few days into their descent 
of the valley. 
The day began 
slowly, 
with Bingham trying 
to arrange 
sufficient 
mules for the next stage of the 
trek. His companions 
showed no interest 
in accompanying 
him up the nearby hill 
to see some ruins that a local farmer, 
Melchor 
Arteaga, 
had told them about the 
night before. 
The morning 
was dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have 
been less than keen on the prospect 
of climbing 
the hill. 
In his book Lost City of the 
Incas, 
he relates 
that he made the ascent without 
having the least expectation 
that 
he would find anything 
at the top. 

D Bingham writes 
about the approach 
in vivid style in his book. First, 
as he climbs 
up the hill, 
he describes 
the evet�present 
possibility 
of deadly snakes, 
'capable 
of 
making considerable 
springs 
when in pursuit 
of their prey'; 
not that he sees any. 
Then there's 
a sense of mounting 
discovery 
as he comes -across great sweeps 
of terraces, 
then a mausoleum, 
followed 
by monumental 
staircases 
and, finally, 
the grand ceremonial 
buildings 
of Machu Picchu. 
'It seemed like an unbelievable 
dream ... the sight held me spellbound 
... ' he wrote. 

43 

Test 6 

E We should remember, 
however, 
that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight, 
not written 
until 1948, many years after his journey. 
His journal 
entries 
of the 
time reveal a much more gradual 
appreciation 
of his achievement. 
He spent 
the afternoon 
at the ruins noting down the dimensions 
of some of the buildings, 
then descended 
and rejoined 
his companions, 
to whom he seems to have said 
little 
about his discovery. 
At this stage, Bingham didn't 
realise 
the extent or the 
importance 
of the site, nor did he realise 
what use he could make of the discovery. 

F However, 
soon after returning 
it occurred 
to him that he could make a name for 
from this discovery. 
When he came to write the National 
Geographic 
himself 
magazine 
article 
that broke the story to the world in April 1913, he knew he had 
to produce 
a big idea. He wondered 
whether 
it could have been the birthplace 
of 
the very first 
Inca, Manco the Great, and whether 
it could also have been what 
chroniclers 
described 
as 'the last city of the Incas'. 
This term refers 
to Vilcabamba, 
the settlement 
where the Incas had fled from Spanish 
invaders 
in the 1530s. 
Bingham made desperate 
attempts 
to prove this belief 
for nearly 40 years. Sadly, 
his vision 
of the site as both the beginning 
and end of the Inca civilisation, 
while 
a magnificent 
on.e, is inaccurate. 
We now know that Vilcabamba 
actually 
lies 65 
kilometres 
away in the depths of the jungle. 

G One question 
that has perplexed 
visitors, 
historians 
and archaeologists 
alike ever 
since Bingham, 
is why the site seems to have been abandoned 
before the Spanish 
Conquest. 
There are no references 
to it by any of the Spanish 
chroniclers 
-and if 
they had known of its existence 
so close to Cusco they would certainly 
have come 
in search of gold. An idea which has gained wide acceptance 
over the past few 
years is that Machu Picchu was a moya, a country 
estate built by an Inca emperor 
to escape the cold winters 
of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental 
architecture 
and spectacular 
views. Furthermore, 
the particular 
architecture 
of 
Machu Picchu suggests 
that it was constructed 
at the time of the greatest 
of all the 
Incas, 
the emperor Pachacuti 
(c. 1438-71 
). By custom, 
Pachacuti's 
descendants 
built other similar 
estates 
for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been 
abandoned 
after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish 
Conquest.

The Benefits 
of Being Bilingual 

A According 
to the latest 
figures, 
the majority 
of the world's 
population 
is now bilingual 
or multilingual, 
having grown up speaking 
two or more languages. 
In the past, such 
children 
were considered 
to be at a disadvantage 
compared 
with their monolingual 
peers. Over the past few decades, 
however, technological 
advances 
have allowed 
researchers 
to look more deeply at how bilingualism 
interacts 
with and changes 
the cognitive 
and neurological 
systems, 
thereby 
identifying 
several 
clear benefits 
of 
being bilingual. 

B Research 
shows that when a bilingual 
person uses one language, 
the other is 
active 
at the same time. When we hear a word, we don't hear the entire 
word all at 
once: the sounds arrive 
in sequential 
order. 
Long before the word is finished, 
the 
brain's 
language 
system begins to guess what that word might be. If you hear 'can', 
you will likely 
activate 
words like 'candy' 
and 'candle' 
as werl, at least during the 
earlier 
stages of word recognition. 
For bilingual 
people, 
this activation 
is not limited 
to a single 
language; 
auditory 
input activates 
corresponding 
words regardless 
of the language 
to which they belong. 
Some of the most compelling 
evidence 
for this phenomenon, 
called 
'language 
co-activation', 
comes from studying 
eye 
movements. 
A Russian-English 
bilingual 
asked to 'pick up a marker' 
from a set of 
objects 
would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn't 
know Russian, 
because the Russian 
word for 'stamp', 
marka, sounds like the English 
word he or 
she heard, 'marker'. 
In cases like this, language 
co-activation 
occurs because what 
the listener 
hears could map onto words in either 
language. 

C Having to deal with this persistent 
linguistic 
competition 
can result 
in difficulties, 
however. 
For instance, 
knowing 
more than one language 
can cause speakers 
to 
name pictures 
more slowly, and can increase 
'tip-of-the-tongue 
states', 
when you 
can almost, 
but not quite, 
bring a word to mind. As a result, 
the constant 
juggling 
of 
two languages 
creates 
a need to control 
how much a person accesses 
a language 
at any given time. For this reason, 
bilingual 
people often perform 
better 
on tasks 
that require 
conflict 
management. 
In the classic 
Stroop Task, people see a word 
and are asked to name the colour of the word's font. When the colour and the 
word match (i.e., 
the word 'red' printed 
in red), people correctly 
name the colour 
more quickly 
than when the colour and the word don't match (i.e., 
the word 'red' 
printed 
in blue). 
This occurs because the word itself 
('red') 
and its font colour (blue) 
conflict. 
Bilingual 
people often excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability 
to ignore competing 
perceptual 
information 
and focus on the relevant 
aspects 
of 
the input. 
Bilinguals 
are also better 
at switching 
between two tasks; 
for example, 
when bilinguals 
have to switch from categorizing 
objects 
by colour (red or green) 

46 

Reading 

to ·categorizing 
them by shape (circle 
or triangle), 
they do so more quickly 
than 
monolingual 
people, 
reflecting 
better 
cognitive 
control 
when having to make rapid 
cl1anges of strategy. 

D It also seems that the neurological 
roots of the bilingual 
advantage 
extend to brain 
ar-eas more traditionally 
associated 
with sensory 
processing. 
When monolingual 
and bilingual 
adolescents 
listen 
to simple speech sounds without 
any intervening 
background 
noise, 
they show highly 
similar 
brain stem responses. 
When 
researchers 
play the same sound to both groups in the presence 
of background 
noise, 
however, 
the bilingual 
listeners' 
neural 
response 
is considerably 
larger, 
reflecting 
better 
encoding 
of the sound's 
fundamental 
frequenc
y, a feature 
of sound 
closely 
related 
to pitch perception. 

E Such improvements 
in cognitive 
and sensory 
processing 
may help a bilingual 
person to process 
information 
in the environment, 
and help explain 
why bilingual 
adults 
acquire 
a third language 
better 
than monolingual 
adults 
master a second 
language. 
This advantage 
may be rooted in the skill 
of focussing 
on information 
about the new language 
while reducing 
interference 
from the languages 
they 
al ready know. 

F Research 
also indicates 
that bilingual 
experience 
may help to keep the cognitive 
mechanisms 
sharp by recruiting 
alternate 
brain networks 
to compensate 
for those 
that become damaged during 
aging. 
Older bilinguals 
enjoy improved 
memory 
relative 
to monolingual 
people, 
which can lead to real-world 
health 
benefits. 
In a 
study of over 200 patients 
with Alzheimer's 
disease, 
a degenerative 
brain disease, 
bilingual patients 
reported 
showing 
initial 
symptoms 
of the disease 
an average 
of five years later than monolingual 
patients. 
In a follow-up 
study, researchers 
compared 
the brains 
of bilingual 
and monolingual 
patients 
matched on the severity 
of Alzheimer's 
symptoms. 
Surprisingly, 
the bilinguals' 
brains 
had more physical 
signs of disease 
than their monolingual 
counterparts, 
even though their outward 
behaviour 
and abilities 
were the same. If the brain is an engine, 
bilingualism 
may 
help it to go farther 
on the same amount of fuel. 

G Furthermore, 
the benefits 
associated 
with bilingual 
experience 
seem to start 
very early. In one study, 
researchers 
taught 
seven-month-old 
babies growing 
up·in monolingual 
or bilingual 
homes that when they heard a tinkling 
sound, a 
puppet appeared 
on one side of a screen. 
Halfway 
through 
the study, 
the puppet 
began appearing 
on the opposite 
side of the screen. 
In order to get a reward, 
the 
infants 
had to adjust 
the rule they'd 
learned; 
only the bilingual 
babies were able to 
successfully 
learn the new rule. This suggests 
that for very young children, 
as well 
as for older people, 
navigating 
a multilingual 
environment 
imparts 
advantages 
that 
transfer 
far beyond language.

Flying tortoises 

An airborne 
reintroduction 
programme 
has helped conservationists 
take 
significant 
steps to protect 
the endangered 
Galapagos tortoise. 

A Forests 
of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains 
that separate 
the 
of the Galapagos 
island 
of lsabela 
from the Pacific 
Ocean. With its 
interior 
five distinct volcanoes, the 
island 
resembles 
a lunar landscape. 
Only the thick 
vegetation 
at the skirt of the often cloud-covered 
peak of Sierra Negra offers 
respite 
from the barren terrain below. 
This inhospitable 
environment 
is home to the giant 
Galapagos 
tortoise. Some 
time after the Galapagos's 
birth, 
around five 
million 
y ears ago, the islands 
were colonised 
by one or more tortoises 
from mainland 
South America. 
As these ancestral 
tortoises 
settled 
on the individual 
islands, 
the 
different 
populations adapted 
to their unique environments, 
giving 
rise to at least 
14 different subspecies. 
Island 
life agreed with them. In the absence of significant 
predators, 
they grew to become the largest 
and longest-living 
tortoises 
on the 
planet, 
weighing 
more than 400 kilograms, 
occasionally 
exceeding 
1.8 metres in 
length and living 
for more than a century. 

8 Before human arrival, 
the archipelago's 
tortoises 
numbered 
in the hundreds 
of thousands. 
From the 17th century 
onwards, 
pirates 
took a few on board for 
food, but the arrival 
of whaling 
ships in the 1790s saw this exploitation 
grow 
exponentially. 
Relatively 
immobile 
and capable 
of surviving 
for months without food 
or water, the tortoises 
were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies 
during long ocean passages. 
Sometimes, 
their bodies were processed 
into high­
grade oil. In total, 
an estimated 
200,000 animals 
were taken from the archipelago 
before the 20th century. 
This historical 
exploitation 
was then exacerbated 
when 
settlers 
came to the islands. 
They hunted the tortoises 
and destroyed 
their habitat 
to clear land for agriculture. 
They also introduced 
alien species 
-ranging 
from 
cattle, 
pigs, goats, rats and dogs to plants and ants -that either 
prey on the eggs 
and young tortoises 
or damage or destroy 
their habitat. 

C Today, only 11 of the original 
subspecies 
survive 
and of these, several 
are highly 
endangered. 
In 1989, work began on a tortoise-breeding 
centre just outside 
the 
town of Puerto Villamil 
on lsabela, 
dedicated 
to protecting 
the island's 
tortoise 
populations. 
The centre's 
captive-breeding 
programme 
proved to be extremely 
successful, 
and it eventually 
had to deal with 
an overpopulation 
problem. 

D The problem 
was also a pressing 
one. Captive-bred 
tortoises 
can't be reintroduced 
into the wild until they're 
at least five years old and weigh at least 4.5 kilograms, 
at which point their size and weight -and their hardened 
shells 
-are sufficient 
to protect 
them from predators. 
But if people wait too long after that point, 
the 
tortoises 
eventually 
become too large to transport. 

60 

Reading 

E For years, repatriation 
efforts 
were carried 
out in small numbers, 
with the tortoises 
carried 
on the backs of men over weeks of long, treacherous 
hikes along narrow 
trails. 
But in November 
2010, the environmentalist 
and Galapagos 
National 
Park 
liaison 
officer 
Godfrey 
Merlin, 
a visiting 
private 
motor yacht captain 
and a helicopter 
pilot gathered 
around a table in a small cafe in Puerto Ayora on the island 
of Santa 
Cruz to work out more ambitious 
reintroduction. 
The aim was to use a helicopter 
to move 300 of the breeding 
centre's 
tortoises 
to various 
locations 
close to Sierra 
Negra. 

F This unprecedented 
effort 
was made possible 
by the owners of the 67-metre 
yacht White Cloud, who provided 
the Galapagos 
National 
Park with free use of 
their helicopter 
and its experienced 
pilot, 
as well as the logistical 
support 
of the 
yacht, its captain 
and crew. Originally 
an air ambulance, 
the yacht's 
helicopter 
has a rear double door and a large internal 
space that's 
well suited 
for cargo, 
so a custom crate was designed 
to hold up to 33 tortoises 
with a total weight of 
about 150 kilograms. 
This weight, 
together 
with that of the fuel, pilot and four crew, 
approached 
the helicopter's 
maximum payload, 
and there were times when it was 
clearly 
right on the edge of the helicopter's 
capabilities. 
During a period of three 
days, a group of volunteers 
from the breeding 
centre worked around the clock to 
prepare 
the young tortoises 
for transport. 
Meanwhile, 
park wardens, 
dropped 
off 
ahead of time in remote locations, 
cleared 
landing 
sites within 
the thick brush, cacti 
and lava rocks. 

G Upon their release, 
the juvenile 
tortoises 
quickly 
spread out over their ancestral 
territory, investigating 
their new surroundings 
and feeding 
on the vegetation. 
Eventually, 
one tiny tortoise 
came across a fully grown giant who had been 
lumbering 
around the island 
for around a hundred years. The two stood side by 
side, a powerful 
symbol of the regeneration 
of an ancient 
species.

The Intersection 
of Health Sciences 
and Geography 

A While many diseases 
that affect 
humans have been eradicated 
due to 
improvements 
in vaccinations 
and the availability 
of healthcare, 
there are still 
areas 
around the world where certain 
health issues are more prevalent. 
In a world that is 
far more globalised 
than ever before, 
people come into contact 
with one another 
through 
travel 
and living 
closer 
and closer to each other. 
As a result, 
super-viruses 
and other infections 
resistant 
to antibiotics 
are becoming 
more and more common. 

B Geography 
can often play a very large role in the health concerns 
of certain 
populations. 
For instance, 
depending 
on where you live, you will not have the same 
health concerns 
as someone who lives in a different 
geographical 
region. 
Perhaps 
one of the most obvious 
examples 
of this idea is malaria-prone 
areas, which are 
usually 
tropical 
regions 
that foster 
a warm and damp environment 
in which the 
mosquitos 
that can give people this disease 
can grow. Malarip 
is much less of a 
problem 
in high-altitude 
deserts, 
for instance. 

C In some countries, 
geographical 
factors 
influence 
the health and well-being 
of 
the population 
in very obvious 
ways. In many large cities, 
the wind is not strong 
enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution 
that cause 
asthma, 
lung problems, 
eyesight 
issues and more in the people who live there. 
Part 
of the problem 
is, of course, 
the massive number of cars being driven, 
in addition 
to factories 
that run on coal power. The rapid industrialisation 
of some countries 
in 
recent years has also led to the cutting 
down of forests 
to allow for the expansion 
of 
big cities, 
which makes it even harder to fight the pollution 
with the fresh air that is 
produced 
by plants. 

D It is in situations 
like these that the field of health geography 
comes into its own. It 
is an increasingly 
important 
area of study in a world where diseases 
like polio are 
re-emerging,-
respiratory 
diseases 
continue 
to spread, 
and malaria-prone 
areas 
are still 
fighting 
to find a better 
cure. Health geography 
is the combination 
of, on 
the one hand, knowledge 
regarding 
geography 
and methods used to analyse 
and -­
interpret 
geographical 
information, 
and on the other, 
the study of health, 
diseases 
and healthcare 
practices 
around the world. The aim of this hybrid science 
is to 
create solutions 
for common geography-based 
health problems. 
While people will 
always be prone to illness, 
the study of how geography 
affects 
our health could 
lead to the eradication 
of certain 
illnesses, 
and the prevention 
of others in the 
future. 
By understanding 
why and how we get sick, we can change the way we 
treat illness 
and disease 
specific 
to certain 
geographical 
locations. 

63 

Test 7 

E The geography 
of disease 
and ill health analyses 
the frequency 
with which certain 
diseases 
appear in different 
parts of the world, and overlays 
the data with the 
geography 
of the region, 
to see if there could be a correlation 
between the two. 
Health geographers 
also study factors 
that could make certain 
individuals 
or a 
population 
more likely 
to be taken ill with a specific 
health concern 
or disease, 
as 
compared 
with the population 
of another 
area. Health geographers 
in this field 
are usually 
trained 
as healthcare 
workers, 
and have an understanding 
of basic 
epidemiology 
as it relates 
to the spread of diseases 
among the population. 

F Researchers 
study the interactions 
between humans and their environment 
that 
could lead to illness 
(such as asthma in places with high levels 
of pollution) 
and 
work to create a clear way of categorising 
illnesses, 
diseases 
and epidemics 
into 
local and global 
scales. 
Health geographers 
can map the spread of illnesses 
and 
attempt 
to identify 
the reasons 
behind an increase 
or decrease 
in illnesses, 
as 
they work to find a way to halt the further 
spread or re-emergence 
of diseases 
in 
vulnerable 
populations. 

G The second subcategory 
of health geography 
is the geography 
of healthcare 
provision. 
This group studies 
the availability 
(or lack thereof) 
of healthcare 
resources 
to individuals 
and populafrons 
around the world. In both developed 
and 
developing 
nations 
there is often a very large discrepancy 
between the options 
available 
to people in different 
social 
classes, 
income brackets, 
and levels 
of 
education. 
Individuals 
working 
in the area of the geography 
of healthcare 
provision 
attempt 
to assess the levels 
of healthcare 
in the area (for instance, 
it may be very 
difficult 
for people to get medical 
attention 
because there is a mountain 
between 
their village 
and the nearest 
hospital). 
These researchers 
are on the frontline 
of 
making recommendations 
regarding 
policy 
to international 
organisations, 
local 
government 
bodies and others. 

H The field of health geography 
is often overlooked, 
but it constitutes 
a huge area 
of need in the fields 
of geography 
and healthcare. 
If we can understand 
how 
geography 
affects 
our health no matter where in the world we are located, 
we can 
better 
treat disease, 
prevent 
illness, 
and keep people safe and well.

Passage 3.

Music and the emotions 

Neuroscientist 
Jonah Lehrer considers 
the emotional 
power of music 

Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, 
music is a purely abstract 
art form, 
devoid of language 
or explicit 
ideas. 
And yet, even though music says little, 
it still 
manages to touch us deeply. When listening 
to our favourite 
songs, our body betrays 
all 
the symptoms 
of emotional 
arousal. 
The pupils 
in our eyes dilate, our 
pulse and blood 
pressure 
rise, the electrical 
conductance 
of our skin is lowered, 
and the cerebellum, 
a 
brain region associated 
with bodily 
movement, 
becomes strangely 
active. 
Blood is even 
re-directed 
to the 
muscles 
in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological 
roots. 

A recent paper in Nature Neuroscience 
by a research 
team in Montreal, 
Canada, marks 
an important 
step in revealing 
the precise 
1.mderpinnings 
of 'the potent pleasurable 
stimulus' 
that is music. Although 
the study involves 
plenty 
of fancy technology, 
including 
functional 
magnetic resonance 
imaging 
(fMRI) and ligand-based 
positron 
emission 
tomography 
(PET) scanning, 
the experiment 
itself 
was rather straightforward. 
After 
screening 
217 individuals 
who responded 
to advertisements 
requesting 
people who 
experience 
'chills' 
to instrumental 
music, the scientists 
narrowed 
down the subject 
pool 
to ten. They then asked the subjects 
to bring in their playlist 
of favourite 
songs -virtually 
every genre was represented, 
from techno to tango -and played them the music while 
their brain activity 
was monitored. 
Because the scientists 
were combining 
methodologies 
(PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively 
exact and detailed 
portrait 
of 
music in the brain. 
The first 
thing they discovered 
is that music triggers 
the production 
of dopamine 
- a chemical 
with a key role in setting 
people's 
moods -by the neurons 
(nerve cells) 
in both the dorsal and ventral 
regions 
of the brain. 
As these two regions 
have long been linked 
with the experience 
of pleasure, 
this finding 
isn't particularly 
surprising. 

What is rather 
more significant 
is the finding 
that the dopamine 
neurons 
in the 
caudate 
- a region of the brain involved 
in learning 
stimulus-response 
associations, 
and in anticipating 
food and other 'reward' 
stimuli 
-were at their most active 
around 
15 seconds before the participants' 
favourite 
moments in the music. The researchers 
call this the 'anticipatory 
phase' and argue that the purpose 
of this activity 
is to help 
us predict 
the arrival 
of our 
favourite 
part. The question, 
of course, 
is what all these 
dopamine 
neurons are up 
to. Why are they so 
active 
in the period preceding 
the 
acoustic 
climax? After all, 
we typically 
associate surges 
of dopamine 
with pleasure, 
with 
the processing 
of actual 
rewards. 
And yet, this cluster 
of cells is most active 
when the 
'chills' have yet 
to arrive, 
when the melodic 
pattern 
is still 
unresolved.

Reading 

One way to answer the question 
is to look at the music and not the neurons. 
While 
music can often seem (at least to the outsider) 
like a labyrinth 
of intricate 
patterns, 
it 
turns out that the most important 
part of every song or symphony 
is when the patterns 
break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. 
If the music is too obvious, 
it is 
annoyingly 
boring, 
like an alarm clock. 
Numerous 
studies, 
after all, have demonstrated 
that dopamine 
neurons 
quickly 
adapt to predictable 
rewards. 
If we know what's going 
to happen next, then we don't get excited. 
This is why composers 
often introduce 
a 
key note in the beginning 
of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious 
avoidance 
of the pattern, 
and then finally 
repeat it only at the end. The longer 
we are 
denied the pattern 
we expect, 
the greater 
the emotional 
release 
when the pattern 
returns, 
safe and sound. 

To demonstrate 
this psychological 
principle, 
the musicologist 
Leonard 
Meyer, in his 
book Emotion 
and Meaning in Music (1956), 
analysed 
the 5th movement 
of 
classic 
Beethoven's 
String 
Quartet 
in C-sharp 
minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how 
music is defined 
by its flirtation 
with -but not submission 
to -our expectations 
of order. 
Meyer dissected 
50 measures 
(bars) 
of the masterpiece, 
showing 
how Beethoven 
begins with the clear statement 
of a rhythmic 
and harmonic 
pattern 
and then, in an 
ingenious 
tonal dance, carefully 
holds off repeating 
it. What Beethoven 
does instead 
is 
suggest 
variations 
of th� pattern. 
He wants to preserve 
an element 
of uncertainty 
in his 
music, making our brains 
beg for the one chord he refuses 
to give us. Beethoven 
saves 
that chord for the end. 

According 
to Meyer, it is the suspenseful 
tension 
of music, arising 
out of our unfulfilled 
expectations, 
that is the source of the music's 
feeling. 
While earlier 
theories 
of music 
focused 
on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences 
-its 
'connotative' 
meaning 
-Meyer argued that the emotions 
we find in music come from the 
unfolding 
events of the music itself. 
This 'embodied 
meaning' 
arises 
from the patterns 
the symphony 
invokes 
and then ignores. 
It is this uncertainty 
that triggers 
the surge 
of dopamine 
in the caudate, 
as we struggle 
to figure 
out what will happen next. We 
can predict 
some of the notes, 
but we can't predict 
them all, and that is what keeps us 
listening, 
waiting 
expectantly 
for our reward, 
for the pattern 
to be completed.

UK companies 
need more effective 
boards of directors 

A After a number of serious 
failures 
of governance 
(that is, how they are managed 
at the highest 
level), 
companies 
in Britain, 
as well as elsewhere, 
should consider 
radical 
changes 
to their directors' 
roles. 
It is clear that the role of a board director 
today is not an easy one. Following 
the 2008 financial 
meltdown, 
which resulted 
in 
a deeper and more prolonged 
period 
of economic 
downturn 
than anyone expected, 
the search for explanations 
in the many post-mortems 
of the crisis 
has meant 
blame has been spread far and wide. Governments, 
regulators, 
central 
banks and 
auditors 
have all been in the frame. The role of bank directors 
and management 
and their widely publicised 
failures 
have been extensively 
picked over and 
examined 
in reports, 
inquiries 
and commentaries. 

B The knock-on 
effect of this scrutiny 
has been to make the governance 
of 
companies 
in general 
an issue of intense 
public 
debate and has significantly 
increased 
the pressures 
on, and the responsibilities 
of, directors. 
At the simplest 
and most practical 
level, 
the time involved 
in fulfilling 
the demands of a board 
directorship 
has increased 
signific
antly, calling 
into question 
the effectiveness 
of 
the classic 
model of corporate 
governance 
by part-time, 
independent 
non-executive 
directors. 
Where once a board schedule 
may have consisted 
of between 
eight and 
ten meetings 
a year, in many companies 
the number of events requiring 
board 
input and decisions 
has dramatically 
risen. 
Furthermore, 
the amount of reading 
and preparation 
required 
for each meeting 
is increasing. 
Agendas can become 
overloaded 
and this can mean the time for constructive 
debate must necessarily 
be 
restricted 
in favour of getting 
through 
the business. 

C Often, board business 
is devolved 
to committees 
in order to cope with the 
workload, 
which may be more efficient 
but can mean that the board as a whole 
is less involved 
in fully addressing 
some of the most important 
issues. 
It is not 
uncommon for the audit committee 
meeting 
to last longer 
than the main board 
meeting 
itself. 
Process 
may take the place of discussion 
and be at the expense 
of 
real collaboration, 
so that boxes are ticked 
rather 
than issues 
tackled. 

D A radical 
solution, 
which may work for some very large companies 
whose 
businesses 
are extensive 
and complex, 
is the professional 
board, whose members­
would work up to three or four days a week, supported 
by their own dedicated 
staff 
and advisers. 
There are obvious 
.. risks to this-and it would be important 
to establish 
clear guidelines 
for such a board to ensure that it did not step on the toes of 
management 
by becoming 
too engaged in the day-to-day 
running 
of the company. 
Problems 
of recruitment, 
remuneration 
and independence 
could also arise and this 
structure 
would not be appropriate 
for all companies. 
However, 
more professional 
and better-inf
ormed boards would have been particularly 
appropriate 
for banks 
had access to information 
where the executives 
that part-time 
non-executive 
directors 
lacked, 
leaving 
the latter 
unable to comprehend 
or anticipate 
the 2008 
crash. 

89 

Test 8 

E One of the main criticisms 
of boards and their directors 
is that they do not focus 
sufficiently 
on longer-term 
matters 
of strategy, 
sustainability 
and governance, 
but instead 
concentrate 
too much on short-term 
financial 
metrics. 
Regulatory 
requirements 
and the structure 
of the market encourage 
this behaviour. 
The tyranny 
of quarterly 
reporting 
can distort 
board decision-making, 
as directors 
have to 'make 
the numbers' 
every four months to meet the insatiable 
appetite 
of the market for 
more data. This serves to encourage 
the trading 
methodology 
of a certain 
kind of 
investor 
who moves in and out of a stock without 
engaging 
in constructive 
dialogue 
with the company about strategy 
or performance, 
and is simply seeking 
a short­
term financial 
gain. This effect 
has been made worse by the changing 
profile 
of 
investors 
due to the globalisation 
of capital 
and the increasing 
use of automated 
trading 
systems. 
Corporate 
culture 
adapts and management 
teams are largely 
incentivised 
to meet financial 
goals. 

F Compensation 
for chief executives 
has become a combat zone where pitched 
battles 
between investors, 
management 
and board members are fought, 
often 
behind closed doors but increasingly 
frequently 
in the full glare of press attention. 
Many would argue that this is in the interest 
of transparency 
and good governance 
as shareholders 
use their muscle in, the area of pay to pressure 
boards to 
remove underperforming 
chief executives. 
Their powers to vote down executive 
remuneration 
policies 
increased 
when binding 
votes came into force. 
The chair 
of the remuneration 
committee 
can be an exposed and lonely 
role, as Alison 
Carnwath, 
chair of Barclays 
Bank's remuneration 
committee, 
found when she had 
to resign, 
having been roundly 
criticised 
for trying 
to defend the enormous 
bonus 
to be paid to the chief executive; 
the irony being that she was widely understood 
to 
have spoken out against 
it in the privacy 
of the committee. 

G The financial 
crisis 
stimulated 
a debate about the role and purpose 
of the company 
and a heightened 
awareness 
of corporate 
ethics. 
Trust in the corporation 
has been 
eroded and academics 
such as Michael 
Sandel, 
in his thoughtful 
and bestselling 
book What Money Can't Buy, are questioning 
the morality 
of capitalism 
and the 
market economy. Boards of companies 
in all sectors 
will need to widen their 
perspective 
to encompass 
these issues and this may involve 
a realignment 
of 
corporate 
goals. 
We live in challenging 
times.

vIsITOR: What's the trail 
like in terms of difficulty? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Quite challenging 
in places. 
It wouldn't 
be suitable

v1sITOR: Hmm. Well, my daughter 
loves cycling 
and so do I, so maybe the two of us 
could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm. That might work out 
quite well. But we don't have bikes here ... is there somewhere 
we could 
rent them? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Yes, there's 
a place here in the city. 
It's called 
Ratchesons. 
vIsITOR: I'll just make a note of that -er, how do you spell it?

TC EMPLOYEE: 
R-A-T-C-H-E-S-O-N-S. 
It's just by the cruise ship terminal.
VISITOR: OK. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
You'd also need to pick up a repair 
kit for the bike from there to take along 
with 
you, and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -it'd be best to get 
those in the city. 
vIsIToR: Fine. That shouldn't 
be a problem. 
And I assume I can rent a helmet from the QB 
bike place? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Sure, you should definitely 
get that. It's a great ride, but you want to be well 
prepared 
because it's very remote -you won't see any shops round there, 
or Q9 
anywhere 
to stay. so you need to get back in time for the last boat. 
vIsITOR: Yeah. So what sort of prices 
are we looking 
at here? 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Let's see, that'd 
be one adult and one child for the cruise 
with farm tour, 
that's 
$117, and an adult and a child for the cruise 
only so that's $214 
dollars 
altogether. 
Oh, wait a minute, 
how old did you say your daughter 
was? 
VISITOR: Fifteen. 
TC EMPLOYEE: 
Then I'm afraid it's 
$267 because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75 Q10 
instead 
of the child fare which is $22 -sorry about that. 
vIsITOR: That's OK. Er, so how do ... 

SECTION 2 

Good morning 
everyone. 
My name's Joy Parkins 
and I'm the restaurant 
manager. 
And I 
understand 
that none of you've had any previous 
experience 
as kitchen 
assistants? 
Well, 
you might be feeling 
a bit nervous 
now, but most of our kitchen assistants 
say they enjoy the 
work. OK, they might get shouted 
at sometimes, 
but it's nothing 
personal, 
and they're 
pleased 
that they have so many different 
things to do, which means they never get bored. And I'll 
tell you straightaway 
that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving 
you 
some more responsibility. 

Q11 

Right, 
well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent 
start. 
Now I'm glad to see none 
of you have unsuitable 
footwear, 
so that's good 
-you need to be careful 
as the floors 
can get 
very wet and slippery. 
Those of you with long hair 
have got it well out of the way, but some 
of 
you'll 
need to remove your rings and bracelets 
-just put them somewhere 
safe for today, and 
remember 
to leave them at home tomorrow, as 
they can be a safety 
hazard. 

Q12 

Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -we don't have any tables 
free for this 
evening, 
and only a few for lunch. Fortunately 
we've got our Head Chef back -he was away 
on holiday 
all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work. Now, I'll tell you a bit 
more about the job in a minute but first, 
some general 
regulations. 
For all of you, whatever 
your age, there's 
some equipment 
you mustn't 
use until you've been properly 
trained, like 
the waste disposal system 
for example, 
for health and safety reasons. 
Then I think there are 
two of you here who are 
under 18 -that's 
Emma and Jake, isn't it? Right. 
so for you two, the 
meat slicer 
is out of bounds. 
And of course none of you are allowed 
to use the electric 
mixer 
until you've been shown how it works. 

Q13 

Q14 

Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful 
job, and I have to say that can be true. 
be working 
an eight-hour 
day for the first 
week, though you'll 
have the chance to do 
You'll 
overtime 
after that 
as well if you want to. But however long the hours 
are, you'll 
get a break 
in the middle. 
What you will find is that you're 
on your feet all day long, lifting 
and carrying, 
so 
if you're not fit now you soon will be! You'll find 
you don't have 
much chance to take it easy -
when someone tells you to do something 
you need to do it straightaway 
-but at least we do 
have a very efficient 
air conditioning 
system compared 
with some kitchens. 

Q16 

Q15 & 

96 

Tests 

Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know. So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins Q17
and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for. 
I'll be trying 
to get 
you to work with as many different people 
in the kitchen 
as possible, 
so that you learn while 
you're 
on the job. One person whose name you must remember 
is David Field. 
If you injure Q18
yourself 
at all, even if it's really 
minor, 
you must report 
to him and he'll make sure the incident 
is recorded 
and you get the appropriate treatment. 
He's trained 
to give basic treatment 
to 
staff himself, 
or he'll send 
you off somewhere 
else if necessary. 
Then there's 
Dexter Wills 
he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something 
like that. Don't just leave 
it and hope no one will notice 
-it's really 
important 
to get things 
noted and replaced 
or there 
could be problems 
later. 
And finally, 
there's 
Mike Smith. He's the member of staff who takes Q20
care of all the stores 
of perishables. 
so if you notice 
we're getting 
low in flour or sugar or 
something. 
make sure you let him know so he can put 
in an order. 

- Q19

OK, now the next thing ... 

SECTION 3 

TRUDIE: OK, Stewart. 
We need to start planning 
our paper on public 
libraries. 
Have you 
thought 
of an angle yet? 
STEWART: Well, there's 
so much we could look into. How libraries 
have changed 
over the 
centuries, 
for instance, 
or how different 
countries 
organise 
them. What do you
think, 
Trudie? 
TRUDIE: Maybe we should concentrate 
on.this country, 
and try and relate 
the changes 
libraries 
to external 
developments. 
like the fact that far 
more people can read than 
a century ago, and that the local population 
may speak lots of different 
languages. 
STEWART: We could include 
something 
about changes 
in the source of funding, 
too. 
TRUDIE: Yes, but remember 
we're only supposed 
to write a short paper, 
so it's probably 
best if we don't go into funding 
in any detail. 
Well, shall we just brainstorm 
a few ideas, 
to get started? 
TRUDIE: OK. We obviously 
need to look at the impact of new technology, 
particularly 
the 
internet. 
Now that lots of books have been digitalised, 
people can access them 
from their own computers 
at home. 
STEWART: And if everyone 
did that, libraries 
would be obsolete. 

STEWART: Right. 

in Q21 

TRUDIE: Yes. 

Q22 

TRUDIE: That's 

STEWART: But the digitalised 
books that are available 
on line for free are mostly out of 
copyright. 
aren't 
they? And copyright 
in this country lasts for 70 years after the 
author dies. So you won't find the latest 
best-seller 
or up-to-date 
information. 
an important 
point.Aoyway, 
I findit_hard
_to • .concentrate 
when I'm.reading 
a 
long text on a screen. 
I'd much rather 
read a physical 
book. And it takes longer 
to 
read on a screen. 
STEWART: Oh, I prefer 
it. I suppose 
it's just a personal 
preference. 
TRUDIE: Mm. I expect that libraries 
will go on evolving 
in the next few years. 
Some have 
already 
become centres 
where community 
activities 
take place, 
like local clubs 
meeting 
there. 
I think that'll 
become even more common. 
STEWART: I'd like to think so, and that they'll 
still 
be serving 
their traditional 
function, 
but I'm 
not so sure. There are financial 
implications, 
after all. What I'm afraid 
will happen is Q23
that books and magazines 
will all disappear. 
and there'll 
just be rows and rows of 
computers. 
They won't look anything 
like the libraries we're 
used to. 
TRUDIE: Well, we'll see. 

97 

Audioscripts 

TRUDIE: Right. 

TRUDIE: I've just had an idea. Why don't we make an in-depth 
study of our local public 
library 
as background 
to our paper? 
STEWART: Yes, that'd 
be interesting, 
and raise all sorts of issues. 
Let's make a list of possible 
things 
we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure. 
For instance, 
um. Q24
we could interview 
some of the staff, 
and find out whether 
the library 
has its own 
budget, 
or if that's 
controlled 
by the local council. 
TRUDIE: And what their policies 
are. I know they don't allow food, but I'd love to find out 
what types of noise they ban -there always seems to 
be a lot of talking, 
but never 
music. I don't know if that's 
a policy 
or it just happens. 
STEWART: Ah, I've often 
wondered. 
Then there are things 
like how the library 
is affected 
by Q25 
employment 
laws. I suppose there are rules about working 
hours, facilities for 
staff, 
and so on. 
Then there are other issues relating 
to the design of the building 
and how Q26 
customers use 
it. Like what measures does the 
library 
take to ensure their safety? 
They'd need floor coverings 
that aren't 
slippery, 
and emergency exits, 
for instance. 
Oh, and another 
thing -there's 
the question 
of the kind of insurance 
the library Q27
needs to have, in case anyone gets injured. 
STEWART: Yes, that's 
something 
else to find out. You know something 
I've often wondered? 
TRUDIE What's that? 
STEWART: Well, you know they've 
got an archive 
of local newspapers 
going back years? Well, 
next to it they've 
got the diary of a well-known 
politician 
from the late 19th century. 
I wonder why it's there. 
Do you know what his con_nection 
was with this area? 
TRUDIE: No idea. Let's add it to our list of things 
to find out. Oh., I've just thought 
-you know Q29
people might ask in the iibrary 
about local organisations, 
lik� sports clubs? Well. I 
wonder if they keep a database, 
or whether 
they just look online. 
I quite fancy finding 
out what the differences 
are between a library 
that's Q30
open to the public 
and one that's 
part of a museum, for example -they must be 
very different. 
TRUDIE: Mmm. Then something 
else I'd like to know is ... 

STEWART: Right. 

Q28

SECTION 4 

In public 
discussion 
of business, 
we take certain 
values for granted. 
Today I'm going to talk 
about four of them: collaboration, 
hard work, creativity 
and excellence. 
Most people would 
say they're 
all 'good things'. 
I'm going to suggest 
that's 
an over-simple 
view. 

The trouble with these 
values is that they're 
theoretical 
concepts, 
removed from the reality 
of 
day-to-day 
business. 
Pursue values by all means. but be prepared 
for what may happen as a Q31
result. 
They can actually 
cause damage, which is not at all the intention. 

Business 
leaders 
generally 
try to do the right thing. 
But all too often the right thing backfires, 
if those leaders 
adopt values without 
understanding and 
managing 
the side effects 
that arise. 
The values can easily 
get in the way of what's actually 
intended. 

Q32 

OK. So the first 
value I'm going to discuss 
is collaboration. 
Er, let me give you an example. 
On a management 
training 
course I once attended, 
we were put into groups and had to Q33 
construct 
a bridge across a stream, 
using building 
blocks that we were given. 
The rule was 
that everyone 
in the team had to move at least one building 
block during the construction. 
This was intended 
to encourage 
teamwork. 

98 

Test5 

But it was really 
a job best done by one person. 
The other teams tried to collaborate 
building 
the structure, 
and descended 
into confusion, 
with everyone 
getting 
in each other's 
way. Our team leader 
solved the challenge 
brilliantly. 
She simply asked everyone 
in the team 
to move a piece a few centimetres, 
to comply with the rule, and 
then let the person in the 
team with an aptitude 
for puzzles 
like this build it alone. 
We finished 
before any other team. 
My point is that the task wasn't 
really 
suited 
to teamworking, 
so why make it one? 

on Q34 

Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency 
- a common cause of poor sales. 
In the case of Q35 
a smartphone 
that a certain 
company launched, 
one director 
wanted to target 
the business 
market. and another demanded 
it was aimed at consumers. 
The company wanted both 
directors 
to be involved, 
so gave the product 
a consumer-friendly 
name. but marketed 
it to 
companies. 
The result was 
that it met the needs of neither 
group. It would have been better 
to let one director 
or the other have his way, not both. 

Now industriousness, 
or hard work. It's easy to mock people who say they 
work hard: after 
all, a hamster 
running around 
in a wheel is working 
hard -and getting nowhere. 
Of course 
hard work is valuable, 
but only when properly 
targeted. 
Otherwise 
it wastes the resources Q36 
that companies 
value most -time and energy. 
And that's 
bad for the organisation. 
There's 
a management 
model that groups people according 
to four criteria: 
clever, hard-
working, 
stupid 
and lazy. Here 'lazy' 
means having a rational 
determination 
not to carry out Q37 
unnecessary 
tasks. 
It doesn't 
mean trying to 
avoid work altogether. 
Most people display 
two 
of these characteristics, 
and the most 
valuable 
people are those who 
are both clever 
and 
lazy: they possess 
intellectual 
clarity, 
anq they don't rush into 
making decisions. 
They come 
up with solutions 
to save the time and 
energy spentby 
the stupid 
and hard-working 
group. 
Instead 
of throwing 
more man-hours 
at a problem, 
the clever and lazy group looks for a more 
effective 
solution. 
Next we come to creativity. 
This often 
works well -creating 
an attention-grabbing 
TV 
commercial, 
for example, 
might lead to increased 
sales. 
But it isn't 
always a good thing. 
Some advertising 
campaigns 
are remembered 
for their creativity, 
without having 
any effect 
on sales. 
This happened 
a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate 
bar: subsequent Q38 
research 
showed that plenty 
of consumers remembered 
the adverts. 
but had no idea what 
was being advertised. 
The trouble 
is that the creator 
derives 
pleasure 
from coming up with 
the idea, and wrongly 
assumes the audience 
for the campaign 
will share that feeling. 

A company that brings 
out thousands 
of new products 
may seem more creative 
than a 
company that only has a few, but it may be 
creative, 
and make smaller 
profits. 
Creativity 
needs to be targeted. 
to solve a problem 
that the company has identified. 
Just coming up with 
more and more novel products 
isn't necessarily 
a good thing. 

Q39

that claim they 'striveJor

but __ 
it takes a long time to achieve 
excellence. 
In business, 
being first with a product 
is more 
profitable 
than having the best 
product.

followers, 
the companies 
that copied and improved 
on that product. 
The study found that the Q40
pioneers 
commanded 
an average 
market share of 29 percent. 
while the followers 
achieved 
less than half that. only 13 percent 
-even though 
their product 
might have been better. 

Insisting 
on excellence 
in everything 
we do is time-consuming, 
wastes energy and leads 
to losing 
out on opportunities. 
Sometimes, 
second-rate 
work is more worthwhile 
than 
excellence. 
'Make sure it's excellent' 
sounds like a good approach 
to business, 
but the 'just­
get-started' 
approach 
is likely 
to be more successful.

That's right, the festival begins on the 16 th of May and goes on till the 19 th
WOMAN: Oh, that's great. I'll be there from the 15 th till the 19 th
. So could you tell me the 
programme, please? 
Well, on the first day, there's the opening ceremony, in the town centre. People start 
gathering around 2 o'clock, to get a good place to see from, and the events will start 01
at 2.45, and finish about 5.30. 
WOMAN: OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there early to get a good spot. 
The festival will be officially opened by the mayor. He'll just speak for a few minutes, 
welcoming everyone to the festival. All the town councillors will be there, and of 
course lots of other people.

of her? 
I certainly have. She was a scientist years ago. 
That's right. She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago, so we're celebrating 
her centenary. 
I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her. I didn't realise she came from 
Kenton. 
Yes. Well, all that will take place in the afternoon, and later. as the sun sets. there'll Q5 
be a firework display. You should go to the park to watch. as you'll get the best view

between children and their grandparents. 
WOMAN: That sounds interesting. It makes a change from children and parents, doesn't it!

SECTION 2 

Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I'll bring you up to date 
with what I know. 
As you know, we're flying firstto. Munich, on Monday the 4th .
The flight is a t 11.30, so it's too early to have lunch at the airport. I suggest we meet there for 011
coffee at 10, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home. 
When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour Q12
operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany. He's already liaised with 
the managers of the theatres we're going to visit, and he's also arranged for an officer of the 
National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay. 
Now last time we discussed this trip, I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now 
I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double 
room. I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros. but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate 
o f 110. That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this 
week. 

013 

On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of 
the theatres, but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange, so instead we'll have a 
· coach trip to one of the amazing·castles in the mountains south of Munich.

-

On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From
talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be
too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must
confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to
an Italian restaurant at home.

014 

On Wednesday afternoon. the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to Q15 
us a t the theatre. She'll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she
chose the actors, and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one. how she worked with
the playwright.

101 

Audioscripts 

Right. Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see, partly 
because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you! 

The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we're going to the 
premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don't have to dress 
formally. I gather it's rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a 
soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be 
able to attend. 

On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was 
commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist. 
We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest. 

Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it'll be in the 
garden of a palace. It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much 
protection from the wind. 

Q16 

Q17 

Q 18

On Saturday. we're going by coach to a theatre in another town. not far from Munich. This will Q19
be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will 
be attending. After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and 
there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region. 

And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday. and it's in the stunning 
setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14 th century: The performance marks the 
fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his 
first professional appearance, all those years ago.

SECTION 3 

Oh good morning. You must be James. I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth. 
Thank you. 
Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies 
course, I'd like to find out something about you. Why did you decide to take this 
course? 
Wel l. my mother is Danish. and although we always lived in England, she used to 
talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit Denmark. We hardly ever 
did. though - my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or 
friends were in England they always came to see us. 
I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be 
studying. 
I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate. 
Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad. Have 
you had any thoughts about that? 
I'm really looking forward to it. And although Denmark seems the obvious place to 
go, because of my family connections, I'd love to spend the time in Iceland. 
Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged. Do you have any plans for when you graduate? A lot 
o f students go on to take a master's degree. 
I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I'm 
interested in journalism. and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing 
for magazines. I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most 
graduates do.

JAMES: Well, I'm really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema. 
That'll continue next term, but the one on Scandinavian literature that's running at the 023 
moment will be replaced by more specialised courses. Oh, and by the way, if you're 
interested in watching Danish television programmes - there's going to be a course 
on that the term after next. 
JAMES: That sounds good. 
Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next 
few weeks? 
JAMES: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas. 
Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be 
difficult to get hold of the books you'll need. Why not leave that for another time? 
JAMES: Right. 
You might find modern novels or 19 th century playwrights interesting. 
I've read o r seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea. 
Fine. I'll put you down for that topic. 
JAMES: Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper? 
First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail. That 
approach certainly has its place, but I think you first need to get an understanding 
of the literature in the context of the society in which i t was produced - who it was 
written for, how it was published, and so on. I also think that's more fruitful than 
placing it within the history of the genre.

Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the

Of course. Have you decided yet what to write about? 
No, I haven't. There's so much that seems interesting - Viking settlement in other 
countries, trade, mythology ... 
Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which 
is kept in the library. It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find i t helpful. I'll 
give you the details in a moment. Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be 
very difficult to choose just one. 
OK. I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year. 
Should I watch that again? 
If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it - it's more fantasy than reality. 
But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch. It makes some 
interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic. 
Right·· --
So then should I work out an outline? 
Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage. And then you should start 
looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise 
according to those headings. 
I see. 
Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading. Make 
sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper 
in full. 
OK. Thanks, that's very helpful.

SECTION 4 

Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably. After all, there was a 
time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions. Conditions have 
improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common. And human resources managers 
nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary. 

What is conflict in the workplace? Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range 
of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to - at the 
opposite extreme - physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying, by which 
I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a 
weaker position. Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be 
described in these terms. 

Q31 

As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it. But often it's caused by 
someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else, in order to feel that 
they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people. 

Q32 

In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the personality o f one Q33 
is in some way incompatible with that of the other person. A general habit of optimism in one 
person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic - not that that 
justifies treating them badly, of course. 

Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their 
team than in the company as a whole. These conflicts are called 'structural', and could come 
about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who 
do any useful work, and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators. 

Q34 

Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned - the situation is likely to be very stressful Q35 
for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months. For the company, if no 
effort is made to deal with conflict, it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown 
of the business. 

Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs - has uncovered some of the reasons 
why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics: 
confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable o f great achievements - with a high level 
o f anxiety, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves o r by the directors of the 
company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their 
decisions. 

In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic. And it's 
particularly difficult to tackle the situation where colleagues, managers and board members 
are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can't agree on strategic issues and on 
where they see the business going. there are real problems. 

Q36 

Q37 

For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an autocratic form 
of management - where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -
would see more conflict than others. Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic Q38 
business model. can suffer 
when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting 
demands. 

more. 

Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects. Of course 
the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place. A good manager, at any level. will make 
efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with, particularly those who report to them. 
That will involve politeness in all communications, and treating them as equals who happen 
to have a different role within the organisation. 

Q39 

104 

Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand. In such cases the human 
resources department often gets involved. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees 
human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive, then an external mediator 
might be able to help. By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been 
happening, they can build a clear picture of the situation, and give feedback that both sides 
will accept, precisely because they're independent.

Hello? 
Hi, Susie, it's Paul here. How are you? Enjoying your new job? You're working at

Yes. I started when the library re-opened a month ago . It's great. 
Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while. 
sus1E: Oh, you should. It doesn't cost anything, and the new library has all sorts of 
facilities. It's not Just a place where you borrow books. For instance, there's an 
area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have 
there. Some people spend the whole morning there. 
Mmm. Wish I had that amount of time to spend!

Q10 

SECTION 2 

In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays 
we offer at BC Travel. Now, the travel business is very competitive and it's important to be 
aware of how the market's changing and developing. In terms of age groups, the over -65s are 
an important market, and one that's increasing steadily year on year. The fewest holidays are 
taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds , and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at 
present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group's also seen the biggest drop 
over the last few years, whereas there 's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken 
by the 55 to 64-year-olds. As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned , bookings there are 
steady, but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected. 

Q11 & 
Q12 

Q11 & 
Q12 

One trend we 're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays 
in which clients do some kind of spec ialised activity. I'm not talking here about adventure 
holidays , where clients take part in high - risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill 
of it. Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music. 
They 're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite , in fact. But they 
do often take place outside the main tourist centres. which gives an opportunity for clients 
to find out more about the local people and customs, and many say this is one of the most 
positive features of these holidays . Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or 

Q13 & 
Q14 

106 

Test 7 

talent, but clients often say that more than this. it's the chance to create lasting relationships 
with other like-minded people that's the main draw. 

013 & 
014 

Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays. Our painting holidays take 
place in four different centres in France and Italy and they're very popular with clients of all 
abilities from beginners onwards. We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -
some of them have been with us from the start. and five addit ional ones will be joining us this 
year so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre. 

As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients 
cook recipes related to one particular country, usually the one they 're staying in. but we focus 
on dishes from a great many different ones. Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis 
on good quality, organic ingredients - that's more or less a given nowadays - and there are 
generally some meat-free recipes included. 

Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, 
and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery . Groups are small, no more 
than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday. and excursions are 
arranged with fully-trained guides . At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the 
photographs taken so that clients can see one another 's work and receive valuable feedback 
from the tutor. 

015 

016 

017 

Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays. In rrel'and and Italy we run ohe-week 
general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness .. Clients start the course with a 
consultation with a trainer, and together the y draw up an individual programme . As well as 
improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built O 18 
up in their daily lives. 

In Greece. we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their 
we ight. This has all the features you 'd expect, like a personalised diet programme, but one 
of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. People say 
it's far preferable to being in a gym. 

Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the mountain biking 
holiday. Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability. We 
offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular . 

OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so thank you very much ...

what's involved in actually writing a case study - I missed the lecture where Dr 
Baker talked us through it. 
OK, well it's quite straightforward . We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton 
Castle site. And you said you'd done some reading about it. 
NATALIE: Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points. 
Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? 
NATALIE: Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that. 
OK , so we can compare what we've read . Then we have to decide on a particular 
problem or need at our site . And then think about who we 're going to interview to get 
more information.

NATALIE: OK. So who'd that be? The people who work there? And presumably some of the 
tourists too? 
Yes, both those groups. So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose . But we 
might also do some of our interviewing away from the site - we cou ld even contact 
some people here in the city. l ike administrators involved in overseein g tour ism . 
NATALIE: OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and fix times and places for 
the meetings. It's all going to take a lot of time. 
Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some 
numerical data that we can add to support our findings. 
NATALIE : And photographs? 
I think we have plenty of those already. But Dr Baker also sa id we have to establish 
with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study. or whether 
they want to be anonymous . 
NATALIE : Oh, I wouldn 't have thought of that. OK , once we 've got al l this information, 
I suppose we have to analyse it. 
Yes, put it a ll together and choose what's relevant to th e problem we 're focusing 
on, and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identi fy any tre nds or regularities 
there . That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots 
of facts. 
NATA LIE : OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next? 
DAVE: Well , then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected to make 
it as clear as possible to our readers. Things like grc;1phs, or tables, or charts ... 

DAVE: 

DAVE: 

NATALIE: Right. 
DAVE: 

Then the case study itse lf is mostly quite standard ; we begin by presenting the 
problem, and giving some background, then go through t he main sections , but th e 
thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we 'd end with some suggestions 
to deal with the problem or need we identified. but in a case study we end up with a 
question or a series of questions to our readers. and th ey decide wh at o ught to be 
done. 
NATALIE: Oh , I had n 't realised that. 

DAVE: 

NATALIE : So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Ho rton Castle 
site is why so few tourists are vi sit ing it. And we 'll find out more from our interv iews, 
but I d id find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be 
because as far as transpo rt goes, access is d ifficu lt. 
I read that too , but th at report wa s ac tually writt e n ten yea rs ago, wh en th e road 
there was rea lly bad, but that's been improved now. And I th ink there's plenty of 
fascinating stuff there for a rea lly good day out. but you 'd never rea lise it from the 
castl e website - maybe that's the problem . 
NATALIE : Yes, it's rea lly dry and boring. 
I read somewh e re a suggest ion that wh at the castle needs is a visitor ce ntre. So w e 
could have a look for some inform ation abo ut that on the internet. What would we 
need to know? 
NATALI E: Well , who 'd use it for a start . It'd be good to know wh at categor ies the visitors fell 
into too, like school pa rties o r retired people, but I think we'd have to ta lk to staff to 
get that inform ation . 
OK . And as we're thinking of suggesting a v is itor ce ntre w e'd also have to look at 
potential problems . I mean, obvious ly it wouldn't be cheap to set up. 
NATALI E: No , but it cou ld be a really good investment. And as it's on a histor ica l site it'd need 
to get spec ia l planning permission. I expect. Th at might be hard .

Right , especially as the only possible place for it would be at t he entrance , and th at's

NATALIE : Mmm .

But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton. At present it's a bit of a ghos t 
town. Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifi cations, the young people 
all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the only people left are 
children and those who 've retired. 
NATALIE : Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that 
tourists m ight cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact. At present 
the tourists can just wander round wherever they want, but if numbers increase , 
there might have to be some restrictions, l ike stic k ing to marked ways. And the re 'd 
need to be guides and wa rdens around to make sure these were enforced. 
Yes, we could look at that too. OK , well .. . 

DAV E: 

Test 7 

029

SECTION 4 

OK , so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife . 
Now I'll discuss a particular examp le. Let's take a look at me rcury. Mercury 's one of the 120 or 
so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbo l Hg. It's a shiny , s ilvery subs tance . 
You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it's not used much for domestic 
purposes now because it's highly tox ic . 

But the problem is that the arnount of merc u ry in the environme nt's increas ing. Th e main 
reaso n fo r t his is the power plants used to prod uce e lect ricity . T he ma in so urce of energy tha t 
m ost of t hem use is st ill coal, and w hen it's burned it releases mercu ry into t he atm os phere. 
Some of this gets deposi ted into lakes and rivers, and if it's ingested by a fish it's not 
ex c rete d , it sta ys in the fis h's body a nd it enters t he food ch ai n . So it's bee n known for some 
time th at b irds w hic h eat fish may be affected, but w hat wa s n't know n until quite recent ly is 
that those that eat insects can also be affected . 

So a woman called C laire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting 
birds . 

And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by merc ury poison ing , she 's 
looking for more subtle sub-effects . And these may be to do w ith the behaviou r of the birds, 
or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems 
with memory, for examp le . And she 's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on 
bird song. Now . the process of song learning happens at a part icular stage in the birds' 
development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by 
·listening to the songs produced by ' its ·father,-rather than by ,any othe r bird. ··· · 

031 

032 

033 

And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male b irds are expose d to 034 
. mercury, if they"eat food contam inate·d with inercuiy, ·then . the so ngs fh-ey-produce -a ren'fEis· -· 
complex as those prod uced by other birds . So quite low-leve l exposure to mercury is l ike ly 
to have an impact on male birds in a nat ural situation , because it can mean that they 're less 
attract ive to female birds , and so it can affect their chances of reproduct ion . 

03 5 

Now the way she's carryi ng out this research is worth thinking about. She 's using a mixt ure 
of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carr ied out outdoo rs in the wild. T he 
lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a 
natural setting, so the experimenter has a much higher level of control, and that means they 
can be more confident about their results in some ways . And of course they don 't have to 
worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them . 

036 

109 

Audioscripts 

So what are the implications here for humans? Well , because many birds are migratory, they Q37 
may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites . For example, it's been found that 
ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters ove r a thousand 
kilometres away, and presumably eaten. But these birds likely had mercury levels high 
enough to warrant concern for human consumption. 

In addit ion, going back to song learning by birds , we saw that this may be affected by 
mercury contamination. Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental 
delays in the acquisition of language, and in fact this process is very similar in the brain 
regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But mercury contamination has 
other important implications for humans as well. It's now known that an unborn child can be 
affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury, and these effects can 
be quite substantial. 

In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing 
or environmental wellbeing. It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from 
power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for 
everyone . Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wild life. But as we 've seen , the 
issues go beyond that , and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully .

It's Margaret Smith. 
Are you looking for a permanent job, Margaret? 
No, temporary. I've got a permanent job starting in a few months ' time, and I 
want to do something else until then. 
What work do you do? 
This will probably sound crazy - I used to be a lawyer, and then I made a 
complete career change and I'm going to be a doctor . I've just finished my 
tra ining. 
Right. And have you had any experience of leading cycle tr ips? 
Yes, I've led several bike tours in Africa. The trip to India that I had arranged to 
lead next month has now been cancelled, so when I saw you were advert ising 
for tour leaders , I decided to apply . 
OK. Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size 
of the group. Some tours are for very experienced cyclists , but we've got a tour 
coming up soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional 
leader . It's a cycling holiday for families . Would that suit you? 
It certainly would. I enjoy working with children, and I probably need some more 
experience before I go on a really challenging trip. 
That tour includes several teenagers : have you worked with that age group 
before? 
Yes, I'm a volunteer worker in a youth club, where I help people to improve their 
cycling skills . Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.

Well that's great. Now the trip I mentioned is just for a fortnight, but there might 
be the possibility of leading other tours after that. Would that fit in with your 
plans? 
That'd be fine. I'll be free for five months . My job is due to start on October the 
2nd, and I'm available from May the 1 st until late September. 
Good. Now is there anything I need to know about the food you eat? We usually 
have one or two people in the group who don't eat meat, or have some sort of 
food allergy, so we're always very careful about that. 
MARGARET : Yes, I'm allergic to cheese . Would that be a problem? 
No, as long as we have enough notice, we can deal with that. 
That's great.

W~Jc_ome ta. this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city, 
As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep , 
but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing , vibrant area of the city, which is also home to 
one of the city 's fastest-growing communities. The nearby university has always meant the 
area's popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates 
embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments 
recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live . 

The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures. jewellery and 
ceramics which won't break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables . 
There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all

Audioscripts 

over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the 
city 's first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today . 

The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there's a policy of encouraging new young 
designers. The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate 
about fashion. This year they 've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from th e 
music and technology that's part of their everyday l ife, using both natural and man-made 
fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers, and the 
winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening. 

Q13 

Parking at the Sheepmarket 
is easy. There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces 
on the roadsides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want 
to spend the day there it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It's not 
expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores. you 'll not be charged Q14 
at all. After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very 
reasonable. 

The Sheepmarket 
is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country. 
If you look at our map, you ' ll see some of the main attractions there . Most visitors start from 
Crawley Road , at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in Q15 
the city. and is open to the public. It's on the north side of Crawley Road. next to the footpath 
that leads to the public gardens. 

The area 's particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures . The Thumb' is1ust what ~ts name Q16 
suggests. but it's about 10 metres high . You'll see it on Hill Road. across the road froni the 
Bank . 

The Museum 's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes. It's on the east 
side of the Sheepmarket. on City Road. It's on the other side of the road from the pub lic 
gardens. immediately facing the junction with Hill Road. 

Q17 

The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off St ation Square. not far fr om the Q18 
public gardens. The road ends at th e gallery - it doesn't go anywhere else. That's open eve ry 
day except Mondays . 

The W a rner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art. It's on City Ro ad . near the junction with 
Crawley Road. on th e same side of the road as th e public gardens. It's op e n on w ee kdays 
from 9 to 5 , and entry is free . 

Q19 

Finally. if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork. the place to go is Nucleus . You Q2O 
ne ed to go from Cr awley Road up through Sta tion Square and east along Hill Road until you 
get to a small winding road turning off . Go up there and it's on your right - if you get to City 
Road you've gone too far. 

SECTION 3 

JO E : 

KAT IE: Joe, you know I'm giving a presentation in our film studies class next w eek? 
Yes. 
KATI E: Well, cou ld we d iscuss it? I could do with gett ing someon e else's opinion. 
J OE: Of course. Ka tie. Wh at a re you going to t a lk a bout ? 
It's about film adap t ations of S hak espea re 's plays. I've got v e ry int erested in a ll th e 
diff e rent approac hes that film dir ec t ors take . 
J OE : Uhuh . 

KATI E : 

112 

Test8 

JOE: 

KATIE: So I thought I'd start with Giannetti, who's a professor of film and literature, and in one 021 
of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations based 
on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels . 
Right. 
I've already made some notes on that, so I just need to sort those out before the 
presentation. I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the worst examples 
of Shakespeare adaptations that they've seen, and to say why. That should be more 
fun than having their favourite versions. 
Yes, I ca n certainly think of a couple! 
KATIE: Right. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow . I came across something on the 
internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film 
clips to illustrate her ideas. 
JOE: Will you have enough time , though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? 
After all , I doubt if you'll be able to find all the cl ips you want. 
KATIE: Hmm. Perhaps you're right. OK, well, I'd better do some slides instead, saying how 
various films relate to what she says. That should encourage discussion. 
JOE : Mmm . 
KATIE : Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because 024 
they're concerned with issues of the time when the film is made. 
You mean things like patriotism, or the role of governments? 
KATIE: Exactly. It's quite tricky, but I've got a few ideas I'd like to discuss.

JOE: 

---------------------------------------------·---·---·--------- . ---~---------------------------------. --------------------------, -------------------------

JOE : 

KATIE : And finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of 
approac hes , and make some comments on them . Do you know the Japanes e filni 
Ran? 
I haven' t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare 's King Lear , wasn 't it? 
KATIE: That's right. It was a very loose adaptat ion. using the same situation and sto ry, but 
moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain. So for example t he 
king 's daughters become sons, because in Japanese cu lture at that time, women 
couldn't succeed to the throne. 
JOE: OK. I hope you're going to talk about the1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think 
that's one of the best Shakespeare films . It really brings the play to life , doesn't it? 
KATIE: Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what 
life was like at the time of the play. 
JOE : Absolutely . Right, what's next? 
KATIE: Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet , the 1996 film, which moves the action into the 
present day. 
JOE : Yes, it worked really well , I thought - changing the two feuding families in the original 
to two competing business empires, even though they're speaking in the English of the 
original play. 
KATIE : YoLJ'd ~xp~ct it would sound really b_izarre, but I found I soon got used to it. . 
JOE: Me too. 
KATIE : Then I thought I'd include a real Hollywood film , one that's intended to appeal to a 
mass commercial audience. 
There must be quite a number of those. 
KATIE: Yes, but I've picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but 
it's more like a typical action hero movie - there are loads of special effects, but no 
unifying interpretation of the play. 
JO E : All show and no substance. 
KATIE: Exactly. Then there's Prospero 's Books, based on The Tempest. That was really 
innovative, from a stylistic point of view .

JOE: 

JOE : Didn 't it include dance and singing and anima t ion, as well as live ac tors? 
KATIE: Yes. it did. I also want to mention Looking for Richard . Did you ever see it? 
No. but I've read about it. It was a blend of a documen tary with a few scenes from 
Richard Ill, wasn 't it? 
KATIE : That's right. It's more a way of looking into how people nowadays conne ct wi th the 
playwright - the play is really just th e starting point. And tha t' l l be where I finish . 
JOE : Well , it sounds as though it'll be very interesting .

SECTION 4 

This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, t he study of sound , in relation to urban 
environments such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself , I think this is an area where 
we're likely to see great changes . In the past , researching urban sounds capes was simple . 
We measured levels of sound in decibels , so I used to take my sound meter and I measured 
the noise somewhere , and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sou nd 
became annoying . 

With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up wha t we call no ise maps , 
maps of the sound environment. But actually these aren't a lot of use . What the y do show is 
that the highest noise levels are generally on roads - well, that's not really ver y surpr ising . 
But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don 't show , because they can 't captur e 
the complex way that sound varies over time . So they ignore important issues such as the 
noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours , and th is 
sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don't have any databases on this sort 
of information . As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact 
that people vary in their perceptions of no ise - so someone like me with years of wor k ing in 
acoust ics might be very different from you in that regard . 

0 3 1 

But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude, they 've been usefu l in providi ng 
information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it's a 
political matter. And that's important - we need rules and regulations because noise can 
cause all sorts of problems. 

0 32 

Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so c ity-dwe llers 
often suffer from interrupted sleep . It's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of 
stress , due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood. A nd there 
are other problems as well, for instance if schoolchildren don 't have a qu iet place to study . 
their work will suffer. 

Now , one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn 't differentiate between different 
types of noise. Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and 
relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels - think of the sound made by a fountain 
in a town square, for example . That's not necessarily something that we 'd want to contro l o r 
reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design . This is 
going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn 't going to help us here . Instead, 
many researchers are using social science techniques, studying people 's emotional response 
to sound by using questionnaires and so on. 

03 3 

0 34 

035 

So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent 
interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradi ctory - Q._ 036 
city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of 
high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee mach ine, but these mustn 't be too intrusive. 
because at the same time we need to be able to relax. 

114 

One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to 
use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very 
little training in this area. But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add 
to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they tend to see it as something to be 
avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that's just a job for engineers like the 
street drainage system. 

TestB 

037 

What's needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something 
that has the qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to 
know what governs it and how designers can work with it. We need to develop a complex 
understanding of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? What 
can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with 
human development and social relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and 
feelings? Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself? 

Today's powerful technologies can also help us . To show us their ideas and help us to 
imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual 
reality- but these programs are silent. In the future such programs could use realistic 
sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using 
the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the 
ears as well as the eyes.

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate covers the key features and rounds off the description with an 
overview. Organisation is evident, however not wholly logical, and it is sometimes 
difficult to relate data to specific age groups. Vocabulary is just about adequate, 
but is rather dependent on input material [regular physical activity I percentage]: 
original material is limited to e.g. [teenager I mid-twenties] with a lot of inaccuracy 
in word formation. Most sentence forms consist of simple structures and these 
are often inaccurate [bars's changed and interesting I men's percentage are 
increasing I the percentage more decrease unti�, though there is some accuracy in 
comparative forms [is higher than].

TEST 5, WRITING TASK 2 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate addresses all parts of the prompt, although there is some 
misunderstanding of the term shared freely. Ideas relating to each sector 
mentioned in the prompt are presented, yet there is not much development of 
these, especially of sharing ideas in the business world. There is a clear overall 
progression, with the candidate's own opinion presented at the end, but there 
are some errors in the use of cohesive devices [working there on out of this I 
which scientist]. Lexis is mainly appropriate for the task, though there are some 
errors in word choice [actual I releases] and spelling [govenment I limite I 
theme I loose]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, with a fair 
degree of accuracy: errors in grammatical control seldom prevent meaning from 
coming through.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The response looks at some advantages and disadvantages of the topic, but 
does not reach any conclusion. As a result, there is a lack of overall progression, 
although organisation is evident and cohesive devices are used (though rather 
mechanically) [One of advantages I For example I A/so I Another disadvantage I 
For instance]. The range of lexis is adequate for the task, however there are often 
spelling mistakes [contries I yonge I quilifiedj and errors in word choice or formation 
[chancing to improve I unemployee problem]. There are attempts to produce 
complex sentence forms, but there is a lack of grammatical control which can 
cause some difficulty for the reader [ ... due to some countries limit the population, if 
that have more young children it will over limit].

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate organises the information well and describes the trends in the 
various groups, but the lack of data to support the descriptions is a significant 
omission. There is a clear progression throughout the response, with good 
management of cohesive devices [percentage of people who I during the same 
period I in these segments o f the chart I the groups in which I such facilities]. Lexis 
shows some flexibility and precision [on a weekly basis] and there is evidence of 
less common items [segments I major changes I most of the population I most/ 
least popular I with the exception 
with few errors in word choice [visualises I be 
I clients]. There is a variety of complex structures used with flexibility and accuracy, 
but there are also a few errors in grammatical control and in punctuation.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 7.5 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is a good response which would achieve an even higher score if there was 
more focus on large sums of money and on between cities. The writing is well 
organised and there is a clear progression throughout, although the use of some 
cohesive devices could be more flexible. There is a wide range of vocabulary, 
used appropriately and naturally, [preferred method of transporlation I leave the 
driving to the professional I more affordable I ever-expanding urban populations I 
embrace the idea of], but some spelling errors are noted [Communters I whi// I cheif 
I ammount I busses]. There is a wide range of structures and again, these are used

TEST 8, WRITING TASK 1 

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

The candidate has provided a clear introduction and an overview of the key 
stages of the process. Each stage is identified and described, although there are 
some minor errors in the reporting of stage 5. There is room for expansion of the 
description of each stage, which could help to achieve a higher score. There is a 
clear overall progression, with each stage being signalled by appropriate markers 
[First I in order to I After that I At this point I Then, the final step I Finally]. These 
markers are adequate, but a higher score might be achieved by varying their 
position in each sentence, rather than always placing them at the beginning. The 
range of vocabulary is adequate for the task and there are attempts to use more 
variety here [five general steps I connected I accumulated], though there are 
some examples of error in word choice .[box I tank I a circle movements I a circular 
movement], in spelling [undergrownd I trough I conteiner I sumary] and in word 
formation [condensered I condensed I gas I gaseous I :trasladated I transferred? I 
condensering I condensing]. There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, 
including accurate use of passive forms. There are some errors [a/ an I who I 
what], but otherwise the level of accuracy is good. The same level of accuracy, over 
a wider range of sentence forms, would increase the score on Grammatical Range 
and Accuracy.

SAMPLE ANSWER 

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.0 score. Here is the 
examiner's comment: 

This is an attempt to address the prompt and some main ideas are put forward, 
but there is no discussion of is likely to result in a society of individuals who 
only think about their own wishes. This omission, and the fact that the response 
is underlength, limit the Band score rating. Organisation is evident, however the 
answer lacks contextualisation, and cohesion within sentences is sometimes 
faulty [that is cause many African children to ... I they will show respect to their 
ad community in is genera�. Vocabulary is the strongest aspect of the response 
[confident I make mistakes I dictate I the right path I do something wrong I manage 
their affairs I vandals and aggressors I determine their own choices I show respect 
I oppressed I respect children I justify] and although spelling errors occur, they do 
not generally prevent meaning from coming through [becouse I fought I smagging]. 
Grammatical control is variabl.e: some complex structures are produced accurately 
while other, simpler, forms contain errors. Punctuation and capitalisation are also 
sometimes faulty.
